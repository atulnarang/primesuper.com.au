                                        <p>“Radek’s service is excellent. He happily travelled out to see our employees at two different locations to cover any queries they had relating to their superannuation accounts, and to make any required adjustments for them.  Radek also worked through the process of the new superannuation clearing house requirements back at our office which made the new process very clear. Radek is a very organised guy to deal with and provides great service, either by phone, email or in person.”</p>

He comes along to all our functions and gives his support to any members that need any help with their superannuation. Any employees that need help to amalgamate their superannuation into one fund Radek is always ready to assist. My father re-entered the workforce after many years out of it and I immediately turned to Radek who put him on the right track.</p>

                                        <p>Recently I received a call from Radek wanting to come and help me be ready for SuperStream. What I envisaged would be a tedious task proved to be very simple with the guidance that I received.” </p>
