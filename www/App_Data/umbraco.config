            <title><![CDATA[Prime Super’s Prime division]]></title>
            <mainContent><![CDATA[<h2>Insurance options</h2>
<p>Prime Super’s <em>Prime division</em> offers five types of insurance cover to members:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Death</strong> (including Terminal Illness) – Where the balance of your super account plus your insurance cover is paid to your beneficiaries in the event of your death.</li>
<li><strong>Total and Permanent Disablement</strong> - Where the balance of your super account plus your insurance cover is paid to you in the event of your total and permanent disablement.</li>
<li><strong>Income protection</strong> – Where you are paid a percentage of your regular income for up to 2 years if you can’t work due to illness or injury.</li>
<li><strong>Trauma</strong> – In an industry first, you have access to a range of trauma cover options through our partnership with MetLife.* Common covered trauma events covered include heart attack, heart disease, cancer, stroke, paraplegia and numerous other medical traumas.</li>
<li><strong>Private health</strong> - Prime Super provides a special range of health insurance options through our alliance with nib*.</li>
</ul>
<p class="disclaimer">*Premiums are payable directly by you, and not taken out of your super account.</p>
<h3>Default cover</h3>
<p>All members receive 4 units of Death and TPD cover when they join the Fund without needing to provide any medical information. New members can also apply for up to 8 additional units of cover (for a maximum of 12 units) by answering a few easy questions on the member application form.</p>
<h3>Cost of default cover</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each unit of <strong>Death &amp;TPD</strong> cover costs $1.00 per week</li>
<li>Default <strong>Death &amp; TPD</strong> cover costs $4.00 per week</li>
</ul>
<h3>Unitised or fixed cover options</h3>
<p>You can purchase cover in:</p>
<ol>
<li>Units – where the value of cover per unit depends on your age. This means that your premium remains the same but your benefit amount changes as you age.</li>
<li>Nominated fixed amounts – where you choose how much insurance cover you’d like in dollars. With this option, your benefit amount remains the same but your premiums vary year-to-year.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Occupational ratings</h3>
<p>Death and TPD insurance cover is offered at Standard, White Collar and Professional rates.</p>
<p>Income protection is offered at Standard, White Collar, Professional and Special Risk rates.</p>
<p>If you are in a ‘low risk’ occupation you can apply to be covered under White Collar or Professional rates. This means you will receive a higher level of cover for the same price as members on the Standard scale.</p>
<p>For Income protection, members employed in occupations that carry significant risk may be classified as Special risk by the insurer and have an extra premium added to their Income protection insurance rates. This rating has been specifically developed by our insurer so that members who might otherwise not be entitled to Income protection cover could take out cover.</p>
<h3>Maximum cover amounts</h3>
<ul>
<li>$5 million for Death only (including Terminal Illness)</li>
<li>$3 million for Death &amp; TPD</li>
<li>$20,000 per month for Income protection</li>
</ul>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<h2>Insurance options</h2>

<li><strong>Income protection</strong> – Where you are paid a percentage of your regular income for up to 2 years if you can’t work due to illness or injury.</li>
<li><strong>Private health</strong> - Prime Super provides a special range of health insurance options through our alliance with nib*.</li>
</ul>
<p class="disclaimer">*Premiums are payable directly by you, and not taken out of your super account.</p>
<h3>Default cover</h3>
<p>All members receive 1 unit of Death, 1 unit of TPD and up to 4 units of income protection cover when they join the Fund without needing to provide any medical information.

          <summary><![CDATA[Insure with us to save money and receive tax benefits.]]></summary>
          <mainContent><![CDATA[<h2>Low cost</h2>
<p>Super funds buy insurance policies in bulk. This reduces the premiums paid per member and means you pay less for your policy than you would if you purchased it privately.</p>
<div class="moduleCtaList">
<h2>Australians are critically under-insured&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Less than 1/3 of Australians insure their ability to earn an income.<sup>1</sup> Yet, at the age of 35, individuals are 10 times more likely to be disabled from an illness or injury than to die from it.<sup>2</sup></p>
</div>
<p class="disclaimer"><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lifewise.org.au/facts-research">www.lifewise.org.au/facts-research</a><sup>&nbsp; 2 </sup>ABC Health and Wellbeing Consumer Guides, Death &amp; disability insurance-<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/health/consumerguides/stories/2003/05/08/1837334.htm" target="_blank">www.abc.net.au/health/consumerguides/stories/2003/05/08/1837334.htm</a></p>
<h2>Tax benefits</h2>
<h3>Before-tax premiums</h3>
<p>Another reason insurance is often cheaper through a super fund is because your insurance premiums are paid with before-tax dollars.</p>
<p>That means you don&rsquo;t have to pay tax on your salary <em>then</em> pay your premiums with what is left &ndash; your premiums are paid for before tax has been applied.</p>
<h3>Tax deductions</h3>
<p>Additionally, super funds receive tax deductions for insurance &ndash; and Prime Super passes the savings on to you.</p>
<h2>Automatic (default) cover</h2>
<p>Other industry funds may be reluctant to provide cover to workers in areas and industries such as yours, but Prime Super believes that everyone needs competitive insurance cover, particularly those in manual or physically demanding jobs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why all members receive a level of default cover when they join the Fund &ndash; regardless of their occupation, without needing to provide any medical information.</p>
<div class="moduleCtaList">
<p>People who live outside major cities are 30% more likely to have a long-term health condition from an injury.</p>
<p>This may be due to the physically demanding occupations found outside major cities, such as agriculture, forestry and mining.<sup>3</sup></p>
</div>
<h2>Flexible</h2>
<p>As a Prime Super member you can apply to increase or decrease your level cover at any time.</p>
<p>You may also decrease or cancel your cover and/or switch plans at any time.</p>
<p>Health checks and additional paperwork may be required, but Prime Super will provide you with all of the support and guidance you need to cover you and your family against some of life&rsquo;s unpleasant surprises.</p>
<h2>Simple</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve designed our insurance so it&rsquo;s very easy to understand.</p>
<p>Members of the <em>Prime division</em> of the Fund can purchase cover in:</p>
<ol>
<li>Units &ndash; where the value of cover per unit depends on your age; or</li>
<li>Nominated fixed amounts &ndash; where you can choose how much insurance cover you&rsquo;d like in dollars.</li>
</ol>
<p>Members of the <em>HIP division</em> can purchase cover in units.</p>

<p>On 1 May 2014, Prime Super merged with Health Industry Plan (HIP) and members of HIP became members of Prime Super&rsquo;s <em>Health division</em>. As part of the merger agreement, HIP members retained the insurance benefits they held while members of HIP.</p>
<p>This means that there is an insurance offering for members of the <em>Prime division</em> of Prime Super and another for members of the <em>Health division</em> of Prime Super.</p>
<p>The insurance options available to you will depend on which division of the Fund you are entitled to join.</p>

              <mainContent><![CDATA[<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This is a brief description of the investment option.</p>
<h3>Target asset allocation</h3>
<p>This shows the weighting to each asset class for the investment option. This is a target as outlined in our investment strategy and may not reflect the actual asset allocation for the option.</p>
<h3>Return target</h3>
<p>This shows the expected investment return (after investment and administration fees, costs and taxes) of the investment option over a specified time period. For most options this is expressed as CPI plus a percentage rate of return per annum.</p>
<h3>Return</h3>
<p>This shows the investment return of a representative member (after investment and administration fees, costs and taxes, based on an account balance of $50,000). This return is the net investment return of the investment option over either the last 10 whole financial years or, if the option and any predecessor option has been offered for less than 10 financial years, since inception of the investment option.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 1.17em;">Comparison between Return target &amp; Return</span></h3>
<p>These graphs show the&nbsp;net investment return achieved by the investment option for each full financial&nbsp;year of the last 10 years*. There is a separate graph for the super fund and income stream.</p>
<p>The green line shows the return target &nbsp;while the red line represents the net investment&nbsp;return achieved over the moving 10 year* period.</p>
<p class="disclaimer">* Where the option has been in operation for less than 10 years, the graphs show the returns for the full financial years since inception.</p>
<h3>Investment risk</h3>
<p><span>This shows the level of investment risk associated with the investment option in accordance with the prescribed risk labels set out in the Standard Risk Measure developed by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia and the Financial Services Council.</span></p>
<h3>Statement of fees and other costs</h3>
<p>This shows the annual amount a representative member (with an account balance of $50,000) would pay in administration and investment fees to be invested in the option as at year ending 30 June 2014. This amount does not take into account any insurance costs or transactional account fees (e.g. investment switch fees).

          <summary><![CDATA[Investors come in all shapes and sizes; that’s why we let you choose where you invest your super.]]></summary>
          <mainContent><![CDATA[<h2>Two investment options, two very different final account balances&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The investment option (or options) you choose today can make a huge difference to the amount of money you have when you retire. That&rsquo;s why you should give some serious thought to where you invest your super money.</p>
<p>Meet Jack and Jill. Jack and Jill both work for the same company. They are the same age (20 years old), earn the same salary and have their super paid into the same super fund. They also plan to retire together when they are 65.</p>
<p>The only difference between the two is that Jack is invested in the Fund&rsquo;s Growth option and Jill is invested in the Cash option.</p>
<p>The Growth option is expected to return 8% a year for the next 45 years while the Cash option is expected to return 4%. Based on these expectations, when Jack and Jill finally retire, they will have two very different account balances!</p>
<table border="0" style="width: 100%;">

<h3>Assumptions</h3>
<p><strong>Calculated using ASIC&rsquo;s MoneySmart Superannuation Calculator</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Starting salary is $50, 000 and increases by 3% each year</li>
<li>The only contributions into each account are Super Guarantee contributions each year</li>
<li>The Growth options returns 8.0% p.a for 45 years</li>
<li>The Cash option returns 4% p.a for 45 years</li>
<li>Calculation includes 15% contributions tax</li>
<li>Calculation does not take into account and fees, costs or insurance premiums</li>
</ul>
<h3>What&rsquo;s the big difference? Compound interest</h3>
<p>Compound interest is where you earn interest on your original investment amount, plus interest on that interest. It is different to &lsquo;simple interest&rsquo; - where you only earn interest on your original investment amount.</p>
<p>The difference can be massive in the long-term.</p>
<p>So each year, not only does Jack earn more in investment returns, he also benefits from compound interest on his higher account balance.</p>
<h2>Other things to think about before choosing an investment strategy</h2>
<h3>What&rsquo;s your investment risk profile?</h3>
<p>As an investor, you will have a certain attitude towards the level of risk you&rsquo;re willing to take with your investments. This, in turn will influence which investment strategy you choose.</p>
<p>You might be a &lsquo;no guts, no glory&rsquo; investor who is prepared to take bigger risks if it means a bigger pay day.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you might be very risk averse and prefer a more conservative approach to investing.</p>
<p>Your risk tolerance is very individual. To help you work out your risk profile, take the &lsquo;Investor profile&rsquo; questionnaire in our Investment guide.</p>
<h3>Consider getting professional advice</h3>
<p>Choosing the right investment strategy can be difficult, so it pays to get professional help.</p>
<p>All Prime Super members have access to two levels of financial advice. You&rsquo;ll find more information <a href="/{localLink:1271}" title="Advice">here</a>.</p>
<h2>How to make an investment choice</h2>
<p>You can choose your own investment strategy when you join Prime Super.</p>
<p>Simply fill in the Investment choice section of the Member application form or Retirement income streams Member application form when you join.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re a member, you can change your investment strategy at any time. When you&rsquo;ve decided which option or mix of options is right for you, there are two ways you can switch your investment strategy.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://memberservices.primesuper.com.au/public/Login.aspx" target="_blank"><strong>Go online</strong></a><br />If you&rsquo;re registered for a MemberOnline account you can switch your investment options online. Once you&rsquo;ve logged in, go to the Investment choice tab and follow the prompts. Piece of cake.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Fill in an Investment choice form</strong><br />Simply download a copy of the <a href="/media/1444/primeh-17-investment-choice-form_final-lr.pdf" target="_blank" title="PrimeH-17 Investment Choice Form_FINAL LR.pdf">Investment choice form</a> or <a href="/media/1222/primeh-25-retirement-income-streams-investment-choice-form_final-lr.pdf" target="_blank" title="PrimeH-25 Retirement Income Streams Investment Choice Form_FINAL LR.pdf">Retirement income streams Investment choice form</a>.</li>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<h2>Crediting rates</h2>
<p>We calculate a &lsquo;crediting rate&rsquo; for each investment option within three weeks of the end of every month. The crediting rate will be positive or negative, dependent on the performance of the investment option.</p>
<p>Members who leave the Fund during the financial year will be credited or debited with the monthly crediting rates up to the end of the month of the last declared monthly crediting rate. For the period from this date to the date of withdrawal, the Trustee applies an interim crediting rate which is generally 0%. The Trustee reserves the right to apply a different rate in times of significant market fluctuation.</p>
<p>Members who remain with the Fund for the full financial year will have investment earnings calculated and applied to their account on a monthly basis (following the deduction of any applicable insurance premiums, taxes, fees and charges).</p>
<p>Super fund members have returns allocated to their account at 30 June each year.</p>

          <mainContent><![CDATA[<h2>Proxy voting</h2>
<p>Prime Super takes a strong interest in the corporate governance practices within the companies in which <br />it invests members&rsquo; funds. Accordingly Prime Super, as a shareholder, actively exercises the right to vote <br />on various company related matters for those companies in which shares are held directly. The process <br />is governed by the Proxy Voting Policy developed by the Fund. <br />&nbsp;<br />Proxy voting enables shareholders to vote on proposals influencing a company&rsquo;s operations including <br />changes that are aimed at generating better financial outcomes, the election of directors, governance, <br />and the remuneration of directors and executives. <br />&nbsp;<br />The Fund Trustee votes on all company resolutions of the Fund&rsquo;s Australian shares. The Trustee will <br />vote on these resolutions through a combination of votes cast directly by the Trustee, and votes cast by <br />Investment Managers on behalf of the Trustee. Where votes are cast by an Investment Manager on <br />behalf of the Trustee, the Trustee ensures that its voting intentions are appropriately registered, including <br />by overriding the voting instruction of the Investment Manager if required. <br />&nbsp;<br />The Trustee has appointed an independent proxy voting research adviser to assist in the overall review <br />and assessment of voting obligations on all companies invested in by the Fund, and to provide voting <br />recommendations and research on all the Trustee&rsquo;s voting resolutions. <br />&nbsp;<br />The Trustee utilises the advice of the Investment Manager and the proxy voting research adviser in the <br />process of making a decision on votes to be cast at a meeting of a company. <br />&nbsp;<br />The following links provides a summary of the votes cast on all resolutions of Australian companies owned by the Fund for the relevant six month period.</p>

        <summary><![CDATA[Get the lowdown on the what, how and when of your super obligations.]]></summary>
        <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Super obligations don&rsquo;t need to be complicated. Here&rsquo;s a rundown of what you need to know.</p>
<h2>Why do I need to make super obligations?</h2>
<p>Currently, all Australian employers are required to pay a minimum 9.5% of their employee&rsquo;s Ordinary Time Earnings (OTE) into a superannuation fund. <br /> <br />As an employer, it&rsquo;s your responsibility to choose a default fund for your employees and make regular contributions on their behalf.</p>
<p>Your employees might also be eligible to choose their own superannuation fund. You should make them aware that if they don&rsquo;t, their super will be paid into the default fund of your choice.</p>
<p>You must inform your employees of your chosen default superannuation fund.</p>
<h2>Who do I have to pay super for?</h2>
<p><strong>All employees aged 18 years, who:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Earn $450 or more (before-tax) in a calendar month, and</li>
<li>Work on a full-time, part-time or casual basis.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All employees who are under 18 years, who:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Earn $450 or more (before-tax) in a calendar month, and</li>
<li>Work 30 hours or more in a week on a full-time, part-time or casual basis.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Contractors</strong><br />If a contract is wholly or principally for labour, you are required to pay the contractor SG. A contract can be verbal or in writing and labour can include physical labour and mental or artistic effort.</p>
<p><strong>Temporary Residents</strong><br />If you employ temporary Australian residents who meet any of the above conditions you must make super contributions for them.</p>
<h2>How much do I have to pay?</h2>
<p>The current SG rate is 9.5% of your eligible workers ordinary time earnings.</p>
<p>The SG rate is scheduled to increase incrementally until it reaches 12 in the future. To confirm the most up-to-date rate, please check the <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au/Rates/Key-superannuation-rates-and-thresholds/?page=20" target="_blank">ATO website</a>.</p>
<p>As an employer you will need to be aware of these changes and ensure you calculate a worker&rsquo;s SG amount using the correct rate.</p>
<h2>Payslip reporting</h2>
<p>It is still uncertain whether the government will press ahead with rules requiring employers to report on payslips for both the amount of super contributions as well as the date paid. The changes were expected to commence from 1 July 2013.</p>
<p>Regulations prescribing the information to be included on payslips are yet to be released and the ATO will provide updates on their <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au" target="_blank">website</a>&nbsp;about the changes to payslip obligations as information becomes available.</p>
<h2>How often do I have to pay super?</h2>
<p>You can pay SG contributions as often as you like but at the very least you must make the contributions at least four times each year, by the following cut-off dates:</p>
<table border="0" style="width: 60%;">
<tbody>
<tr><th style="width: 60%;">Quarter</th><th style="width: 40%;">SG cut-off date</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>1 July &ndash; 30 September</td>
<td>28 October</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1 October &ndash; 31 December</td>
<td>28 January</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1 January &ndash; 31 March</td>
<td>28 April</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1 April &ndash; 30 June</td>
<td>28 July</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h2>Choice of fund</h2>
<p>Most Australian workers are allowed to choose which super fund their SG contributions are paid into. If your employees are entitled to choose their own fund (see our <a href="/media/1353/primeh-41-employer-guide_lr-final.pdf" title="PrimeH-41 Employer Guide_LR FINAL.pdf">Employer Guide</a> for more information), you must provide your new employee with a <a href="/media/1362/standardchoiceform-149a9682-3e23-4406-b029-9ad33e75918d-0.dot" title="StandardChoiceForm-149a9682-3e23-4406-b029-9ad33e75918d-0.dot">Standard Choice Form</a> within 28 days of them starting work.</p>
<p>Your employee can use this form to nominate a super fund of their choice.</p>
<h2>You must also select a default fund</h2>
<p>If your new employee does not choose a super fund you must nominate a fund for them and supply them with the fund&rsquo;s details. This means that employees SG contributions will go to the fund you have chosen for your employees.</p>
<h2>Choosing a default fund</h2>
<p>When choosing a fund for your employees you must choose one that meets the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fund must be a complying fund, and</li>
<li>The fund must offer a minimum level of life insurance cover as prescribed by the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Regulations 1993.</li>
<li>The default fund must offer an approved MySuper product.</li>
<li>Prime Super meets all of the default fund requirements.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do I make payments?</h2>
<p>Prime Super has a number of payment options to make employer super contributions simple. You can use direct debit, BPAY, Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) or send us a cheque.</p>
<p>For a more detailed overview of each payment type and which one might suit your business, take a look at <a href="/{localLink:1673}" title="How do I pay contributions?">How do I pay contributions?</a></p>
<h2>What is salary sacrifice?</h2>
<p>Your employees may choose to sacrifice a portion of their pre-tax salary to save a larger superannuation sum for the future. Read more about salary sacrifice and how it can benefit your business <a href="/{localLink:1672}" title="What is salary sacrifice?">here</a>.</p>]]></mainContent>

        <mobileContent><![CDATA[<p>Super obligations don&rsquo;t need to be complicated. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know.</p>
<p>Why do I need to make super obligations?</p>
<p>Currently all Australian employers are required by law to pay a minimum 9.25% of their employee&rsquo;s Ordinary Time Earnings (OTE) into a superannuation fund. This was increased to 9.25% from 1 July 2013 onwards. This is called the Superannuation Guarantee (SG).</p>
<h2>Who do I have to pay super for?</h2>
<p><strong>All employees aged over 18 years old, who:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Earn $450 or more (before-tax) in a calendar month, and</li>
<li>Work on a full-time, part-time or casual basis.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All employees who are under 18 years, who:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Earn $450 or more (before-tax) in a calendar month, and</li>
<li>Work 30 hours or more in a week on a full-time, part-time or casual basis.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Contractors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If a contract is wholly or principally for labour, you are required to pay the contractor SG. A contract can be verbal or in writing, and labour can include physical labour and mental or artistic effort.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Temporary Residents</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you employ temporary Australian residents who meet any of the above conditions, you must make super contributions for them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How much do I have to pay?</h2>
<p>The current SG rate is 9.25% of your eligible workers ordinary time earnings.</p>
<p>The SG rate is scheduled to increase incrementally until it reaches 12% in the future. The next increase (to 9.5%) was expected to take effect on 1 July 2014 however legislation is currently before the Parliament that seeks to delay the increase. To confirm the most up-to-date rate, please check the ATO website</p>
<h2>Payslip reporting</h2>
<p>It is still uncertain whether the government will press ahead with rules requiring employers to report on payslips for both the amount of super contributions as well as the date paid. The changes were expected to commence from 1 July 2013.</p>
<p>Regulations prescribing the information to be included on payslips are yet to be released and the ATO will provide updates on their <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au" target="_blank">website</a> about the changes to payslip obligations as information becomes available.</p>
<h2>How often do I have to pay super?</h2>
<p>You can pay SG contributions as often as you like but you must make the contributions at least four times each year, by the following cut-off dates:</p>

          <title><![CDATA[What is salary sacrifice?]]></title>
          <mainContent><![CDATA[<h2>What is salary sacrifice?</h2>
<p>Employees may forego part of their future salary or wages in return for their employer providing benefits of a similar value. A written agreement with your employee to alter their salary package by exchanging part of their future salary or wages for another benefit is called a &lsquo;salary sacrifice arrangement&rsquo;.</p>
<h2>Super contributions are not a fringe benefit</h2>
<p>If super contributions are made to a complying super fund via a salary sacrifice arrangement, the sacrificed amount is not considered a fringe benefit for tax purposes. An employer will not be liable to pay fringe benefit tax (FBT) on the super contributions and the contributions will not be included as a reportable fringe benefit amount on your employee&rsquo;s payment summary. Salary sacrificed contributions are generally treated as employer contributions.</p>
<h2>Super contributions are deductible</h2>
<p>If your employee is under 75 years old, you can claim a deduction on all employer super contributions, including salary sacrificed contributions you make to their fund on their behalf.</p>
<p>If the employee has turned 75 years of age, you must pay the super contribution within 28 days after the end of the month that the employee turns 75 years old. The only exception to this condition is if the contribution was required by an industrial award, determination or notional agreement preserving state awards.</p>
<p>Salary sacrifice reduces your employee&rsquo;s taxable income</p>
<p>The sacrificed component of your employee&rsquo;s total earnings is not part of their taxable income for taxation purposes. This means that the sacrificed component is not included as income on their payment summary and isn&rsquo;t subject to Pay As You Go (PAYG) withholding tax.</p>
<h2>Salary sacrificing super contributions could save your employees tax</h2>
<p>Super contributions made under salary sacrifice are taxed in the super fund at 15%. Generally, this amount of tax is less than the amount your employee would pay if they did not enter into a salary sacrifice agreement, and instead were subject to PAYG withholding tax on their earnings.</p>
<h2>How much can your employee salary sacrifice?</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s generally no limit to the amount your employee can salary sacrifice, unless there are limits specified in any applicable industrial laws, award, workplace agreement or employment contract under which your employee is working.</p>
<p>Salary sacrificed and employer Super Guarantee (SG) contributions form part of the member&rsquo;s concessional contributions in the fund. Concessional contributions are included in the assessable income of the fund and taxed at 15%. Contributions made in excess of the cap will be included in an employee&rsquo;s income and taxed at their marginal rates. In addition, the contributions will incur an excess concessional contributions charge and the employee will receive a non-refundable tax offset equal to the 15% tax paid by their fund on this amount.</p>
<p>Please note that the general concessional (before tax) contributions cap for 2013-14 is $25,000.</p>
<p>However, if an employee is 59 years old or over on 30 June 2013, the cap increases from $25,000 to $35,000.</p>
<p>From 1 July 2014, the higher cap of $35,000 will also apply to people who are 50 years or over.</p>
<p>When salary sacrificing super contributions, your employee will need to consider how the amount of contributions will affect the amount of tax paid in their fund.</p>
<h2>How does salary sacrificing affect your SG obligations?</h2>
<p>Making salary sacrificed super contributions into your employee&rsquo;s super fund may affect your SG obligations in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Super guarantee payment is calculated on the reduced salary<br /><span style="font-size: 13px;">The amount of super guarantee you&rsquo;re required to pay for your employee is worked out on their earnings base. As entering into a salary sacrifice arrangement reduces your employee&rsquo;s earnings base, it will reduce the amount of super guarantee that you are required to pay.<br /><br /></span></li>
<li>The salary sacrificed amount counts towards your SG payment obligations<br /><span style="font-size: 13px;">To enter into an effective salary sacrifice arrangement with your employee, you should have a written agreement that states the terms and conditions of that agreement. If you make the super contributions to an employee&rsquo;s fund under a salary sacrifice agreement, the sacrificed amount is treated as an employer contribution. This means that the salary sacrificed amount counts towards your super guarantee contribution obligations. If the salary sacrificed super contribution is more than the super guarantee amount you are required to pay (currently 9.25% of your employee&rsquo;s earnings), then you would not be required to pay an additional amount on top of the salary sacrificed amount.<br /><br /></span><span style="font-size: 13px;">The terms of some awards or agreements may require an employer to pay a certain amount of super for an employee or may require super to be paid on the employee&rsquo;s pre-sacrifice salary. In these circumstances, salary sacrifice amounts may not reduce the employer&rsquo;s super obligation as stated in the award or agreement.<br /><br /></span><span style="font-size: 13px;">Although you can technically reduce the amount of SG you pay for your employee, this is not considered best practice. Continuing to pay the same amount of SG, even on the reduced salary amount is considered an employee benefit.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Can you continue making SG payments based on your employee&rsquo;s pre-sacrificed salary amount?</h2>
<p>If you or your employee want SG payments to be made based on their earnings before salary sacrificing, you will need to negotiate this as part of the employment contract.</p>
<p>Under the Super Guarantee law, you&rsquo;re not required to contribute more than the minimum legislated amount.</p>
<h2>When do you need to make the salary sacrifice contributions into your employee&rsquo;s super fund to claim a deduction?</h2>
<p>If you wish to claim a deduction for any sacrificed contributions you make to your employee&rsquo;s fund, you need to ensure that the contributions are made in the same income year that you intend to claim a deduction.</p>
<h2>Remember to keep records</h2>
<p>When you enter into a salary sacrifice agreement the Australian Tax Office (ATO) needs you to keep relevant records for five years. This includes copies of your agreement and documents showing any expenses.</p>

          <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>We know your time is valuable and meeting super obligations can get complicated. That&rsquo;s why Prime Super has developed a number of options to make it easy to pay and record your super with us.</p>
<h2>SuperStream &ndash; changing the way you deal with your super fund</h2>
<p>In an effort to make the administration of superannuation more efficient, the government has introduced a range of measures (known as SuperStream) that dictate how employers must deal with their super fund.</p>
<p>From 1 July 2015, all employers with 20 or more employees (regardless of whether they are full-time, part-time or casual) will be required to send super information and pay contributions to their super fund electronically and in a particular format.</p>
<p>The new standard will require employers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>send all data <strong>electronically</strong> (such as the employee&rsquo;s details and the amount of super being paid) in a standard message format</li>
<li>make contribution payments electronically</li>
<li>link data and money with a unique payment reference number</li>
<li>ensure data and payments are sent on the same day</li>
<li>respond to fund requests for complete information within 10 business days.</li>
</ul>
<p>Employers with fewer than 20 employees have until 1 July 2016 to meet the new standard.</p>
<p>Our <em><a href="https://employerservices.primesuper.com.au/russell_prod/employer/index.jsp" target="_blank">EmployerOnline</a></em>&nbsp;service will be SuperStream compliant so if you haven&rsquo;t already set up an account, do it today or speak to your <a href="/{localLink:1279}" title="Contact a Regional Manager">Regional Manager </a>for help.</p>

</table>
<p>Please note that from 1 July 2014 these options will only be available to employers with less than 20 employees.</p>
<h2>Sending us your payments</h2>
<p>You have four options for sending your payment:</p>
<h3>1. BPAY</h3>
<p>You can make your contribution payments quickly and securely with BPAY. You must be registered for internet or phone banking, and you'll also need your Prime Super Biller Code and Customer Reference Number. You can find these details on your online employer services account or by calling us on 1800 675 839.</p>
<h4>2. Direct Debit</h4>
<p>You can authorise us to debit your bank account for the amount of each contribution. The amount may vary as we can only debit your bank account for the contribution amount you have reconciled on your Contribution Payment Form on a monthly or quarterly basis.</p>
<p>To get started you will need to complete a <a href="/media/1235/primeh-12-employer-direct-debit-request-form_colour-lr.pdf" title="PrimeH-12 Employer Direct Debit Request Form_COLOUR LR.pdf">Direct Debit request form</a>.</p>
<h3>3. Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)</h3>
<p>You can use your bank&rsquo;s internet banking facilities to make super contributions online.</p>
<p>It is important that you always include your employer reference number in the reference section of the EFT payment. Please note that some banks impose daily limits on the amount of money you can EFT without prior arrangement.</p>
<p>When setting up an EFT, please use the following details:</p>
<table border="0" style="width: 100%;">

<h3>4. Cheque</h3>
<p>If your business employs less than 20 employees, you may choose to pay your super contributions via cheque, however you must move to a SuperStream compliant electronic format by 1 July 2016. &nbsp;Cheques should be made payable to Prime Super.</p>
<p>Remember that, lawfully, you are not considered to have made a super contribution until the super fund actually receives the contribution. This means that if you pay contributions by post or through a clearing house, you need to allow enough time for the payment to be received by the super fund before you can consider that you have made the contribution.</p>]]></mainContent>

        <mainContent><![CDATA[<h2>Retirement and your super</h2>
<p>Retirement presents a significant life change where the regular routine you&rsquo;ve followed for many years, can change overnight. And financially, a whole new set of decisions need to be made.</p>
<h2>The 3 basic options</h2>
<p>When you are nearing retirement, there are three basic options to choose from when it comes to your super. You can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop working altogether and keep your savings in the super environment in an income stream product. You then pay yourself an income from this product, and you can also make lump sum withdrawals as and when required (minimum restrictions apply). Think a pension but paid from your own money.</li>
<li>Reduce your working hours - therefore &lsquo;semi-retire&rsquo; or &lsquo;transition to retirement&rsquo; - and use money from an income stream product to supplement your reduced income (maximum limits apply). You can also make lump sum withdrawals (and remove your savings from the super environment) where eligible.</li>
<li>Stop working altogether or semi-retire, and withdraw eligible savings from the super environment altogether as a lump sum.</li>
</ol>
<p>The option that best suits you will be dependent on your own personal circumstances and financial situation.</p>
<p>More detailed information on your retirement options is available <a href="/{localLink:1506}" title="Retirement Options">here</a>.</p>
<h2>When can I access my super?</h2>
<p>When you retire, access to your super will depend upon the applicable preservation classification. Preserved benefits can generally only be paid upon one of the following conditions of release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attaining you preservation age and taking advantage of a transition to retirement strategy.</li>
<li>Permanent retirement at or after your preservation age.</li>
<li>Reaching age 65.</li>
<li>Reaching age 60 and ceasing gainful employment with an employer.</li>
<li>Satisfying the compassionate grounds tests.</li>
<li>Meeting the financial hardship requirements.</li>
<li>Death (must be paid to beneficiaries).</li>
<li>Suffering total and permanent disability.</li>
<li>Permanent departure from Australia if you are an eligible temporary resident.</li>
<li>Satisfying any other condition of release specified in the super legislation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's my preservation age?</h2>

          <title><![CDATA[Retirement options]]></title>
          <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Retirement can be an exciting time in your life and Prime Super can offer you a number of retirement options that will help make the transition as smooth and enjoyable as possible.</p>
<p>Prime Super can pay benefits as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A transition to retirement income stream,</li>
<li>An allocated income stream,</li>
<li>A lump sum or series of lump sum draw downs,</li>
<li>A combination of the above.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lump sum payment on retirement</h2>
<p>When you reach your preservation age, you can choose to withdraw your super fund as a lump sum.</p>
<h2>Retirement income stream</h2>
<p>An income stream allows you to convert your super into a regular income.</p>
<p>Prime Super members have access to two income stream options.</p>
<h3>Option 1: Full retirement</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Allocated superannuation income stream</strong><br />This option allows you to convert your super into regular income on retirement. It provides easy access to your money and may offer tax advantages. You do not have to be an existing Prime Super member to take advantage of this product, you just need to have more than $10,000 in super and have either met your preservation age or another condition of release.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Option 2: Semi-retirement</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transition to retirement (TTR) income stream</strong><br />If you have reached your preservation age, this product allows you to draw an income from your super <strong>while you&rsquo;re still working</strong>. With this option you can reduce the amount of hours that you work while supplementing your income with an income stream from your super. Or you can place more money into your super and draw on your super savings to supplement your income when you reach retirement age.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this option you can only withdraw lump sums if you meet the conditions of release as specified in the <a href="/{localLink:1154}" title="Product disclosure statements">Income stream Short-Form PDS</a>.</p>
<p>When you retire or reach the age of 65 this will automatically transfer to an allocated superannuation income stream.</p>
<h2>There are also some tax benefits with transitioning to retirement</h2>
<p>Once you start a transition to retirement income stream, the income you earn is not subject to the 15% tax rate that applies to money invested in a pre-retirement super account. This does not affect your ability to contribute to your existing super.</p>
<p>Some methods of payment are not available for some types of benefit and this may change over time. For more information on payment options or how to access your super while still working if you have reached your preservation age, please <a href="/{localLink:1106}" title="Contact us">contact us</a>.</p>
<p>Your super payment may be subject to some form of taxation. To find out the latest information on super taxation, please see the <a href="http://ato.gov.au" target="_blank">Australian Taxation Office</a>.</p>
<h2>It pays to get financial advice</h2>
<p>Choosing the right retirement option for you can be difficult. That&rsquo;s why we recommend you speak to a qualified financial adviser before you make a decision. Read more about the financial advice we can provide <a href="/{localLink:1271}" title="Advice">here</a>.</p>
<p>Information on how to open an income stream account with Prime Super is available <a href="/{localLink:1507}" title="Opening and Income Stream Account">here</a>.</p>

              <mobileContent><![CDATA[<p>When you are nearing retirement, there are three basic options to choose from when it comes to your super. You can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop working altogether and keep your savings in the super environment in an income stream product. You then pay yourself an income from this product, and you can make lump sum withdrawals as and when required (minimum restrictions apply). Think: a pension but paid from your own money.</li>
<li>Reduce your working hours - therefore &lsquo;semi-retire&rsquo; or &lsquo;transition to retirement&rsquo; - and use money from an income stream product to supplement your reduced income (maximum limits apply). You can also make lump sum withdrawals where eligible.</li>
<li>Stop working altogether or semi-retire, and withdraw all eligible savings from the super environment altogether as a lump sum.</li>

<h2>Proxy voting</h2>
<p>Prime Super takes a strong interest in the corporate governance practices within the companies in which it invests members&rsquo; funds. Accordingly Prime Super, as a shareholder, actively exercises the right to vote on various company related matters for those companies in which shares are held directly. The process is governed by the Proxy Voting Policy developed by the Fund. <br />&nbsp;<br />Proxy voting enables shareholders to vote on proposals influencing a company&rsquo;s operations including changes that are aimed at generating better financial outcomes, the election of directors, governance matters, and the remuneration of directors and executives. <br />&nbsp;<br />The Fund Trustee votes on all company resolutions of the Fund&rsquo;s Australian shares. The Trustee will vote on these resolutions through a combination of votes cast directly by the Trustee, and votes cast by Investment Managers on behalf of the Trustee. Where votes are cast by an Investment Manager on behalf of the Trustee, the Trustee ensures that its voting intentions are appropriately registered, including by overriding the voting instruction of the Investment Manager if required. <br />&nbsp;<br />The Trustee has appointed an independent proxy voting research adviser to assist in the overall review and assessment of voting obligations on all companies invested in by the Fund, and to provide voting recommendations and research on all the Trustee&rsquo;s voting resolutions. <br />&nbsp;<br />The Trustee utilises the advice of the Investment Manager and the proxy voting research adviser in the process of making a decision on votes to be cast at a meeting of a company. <br />&nbsp;<br />The following links provides a summary of the votes cast on all resolutions of Australian companies owned by the Fund for the relevant six month period.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re excited to announce that on 1 May 2014, Prime Super merged with Health Industry Plan (HIP). This is great news for Prime Super members!</p>
<h3>Why merge?</h3>
<p>As a larger fund, we&rsquo;ll continue to provide our members with the stability and service you expect from us, but we&rsquo;ll have a greater capacity to offer new and improved member benefits and services. Merging with HIP will position us well for the future &ndash; and ensure we benefit from economies of scale, which will ultimately aim to improve the financial wellbeing of every one of our members.</p>
<p><img style="width: 500px; height: 133.11688311688312px;" src="/media/1060/merger-benefits.jpg" alt="Some description" rel="500,133.11688311688312" /></p>
<h3>Keeping members informed</h3>
<p>Many of the details surrounding the merger are still being confirmed, but we&rsquo;ll continue to share information with you on this page as it comes to light. So, watch this space!</p>
<h3>Merger &ndash; the legal stuff</h3>
<p>The Trustees of Prime Super and HIP have entered into a Merger Agreement, known as a Successor Fund Transfer Deed and Deed of Indemnity.</p>
<p>This means that on 1 May 2014, HIP member account balances will automatically transfer to Prime Super by a legal process known as a Successor Fund Transfer. This process ensures that all HIP members will receive at least equivalent rights to their HIP benefits when they transfer to Prime Super.</p>
<p>From 1 May 2014 HIP members will become members of the HIP division of Prime Super ABN 60 562 335 823 (<strong>merged fund</strong>). The Trustee of the merged fund will be Prime Super Pty Ltd.</p>
<h3>Changes to the Prime Super Pty Ltd Board</h3>
<p>The new trustee Board will include five directors (including an independent Chair) from Prime Super and four directors from HIP.</p>
<p>From 1 May 2014, the New Primer Super Pty Ltd Board will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alan Bowman (Chair) &ndash; Prime Super</li>
<li>David Cooper &ndash; Prime Super</li>
<li>Duncan Fraser &ndash; Prime Super</li>
<li>Russell Collison &ndash; Prime Super</li>
<li>Trevor Dixon &ndash; Prime Super</li>
</ul>
<p>Up to four further directors with experience in the health and related industries will be appointed to the new Board after the merger.</p>

<h3>Update - 18 March 2014 - Limited processing period for members and employers</h3>
<p>There will be a small limited processing period between 29 April &ndash; 5 May 2014 where access to member information may not be available.</p>
<p>***********</p>
<h3>What does this mean for me &ndash; a Prime Super member?</h3>
<p>Aside from the Fund getting bigger, your membership with Prime Super won&rsquo;t change. All of the benefits you currently enjoy as a Prime Super member will remain the same. The only noticeable difference from 1 May 2014 will be a new look and feel across our website and our range of new publications available to you as we welcome HIP into the fold.</p>
<h3>Will there be any impact on the service you provide me?</h3>
<p>We ask you to re-register for an online services account the first time you log in to your online account after May 1 2014. The system will be set-up so that you&rsquo;ll be automatically sent a new password when you re-register.</p>
<p>As part of the merger, we&rsquo;re also transferring all HIP member records from HIP&rsquo;s administrator to our administrator. The process is a complex undertaking, so we ask for your patience if there is a short period of time where you experience limited access to member information or services or a delay in processing contributions and/or benefit payments.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll do our best to keep interruptions to a minimum and post messages on our website where possible. Please make sure you check back here regularly for more information.</p>
<h3>I&rsquo;m a Prime Super member, is there anything I need to do?</h3>
<p>No &ndash; nothing. However we do recommend you regularly visit this site for information on the merger.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you happen to know a HIP member, be sure to welcome them to the Prime Super family! A hug isn&rsquo;t out of the question!</p>
<h3>I&rsquo;m a Prime Super employer, do I need to do anything as a result of the merger?</h3>
<p>At this stage there&rsquo;s nothing you need to do. We&rsquo;ll write to all registered employers in March to provide you with details of the merger and its impacts (if any).</p>
<p>As part of the merger, we will transition to a new administration platform. This will mean some changes to the employer online service (secure site), which will impact the way you pay contributions and provide information to us online.</p>
<p>Some of these changes have been dictated by the Government as part of the Stronger Super reforms. Please be assured that we will provide you with all of the information you need to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible.</p>
<p>We will provide up-to-date information on this page and on the secure site. As always, our team of Regional Managers are there to help you with any questions you may have about any aspect of the merger. If you have any questions or concerns, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to give them a call. You&rsquo;ll find their contact details <a href="/{localLink:1279}" title="Contact a Regional Manager">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Need help?</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got questions or concerns about the merger please contact your <a href="/{localLink:1279}" title="Contact a Regional Manager">Regional Manager</a> or call us on 1800 675 839.</p>]]></mainContent>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Online Services</span></h3>
<p>As part of the merger with Prime Super, all Income stream members will now be able to access their account information online via a secure <em>MemberOnline</em> account. All members will need to register for a <em>MemberOnline</em> account to use the service from 2 June 2014. To do this members will need their current HIP member number, full name, date of birth and postcode.</p>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<p><strong>#1 - What does this mean for HIP members?</strong><br />As part of the merger, the HIP Super fund will be wound up. On 1 May 2014, all HIP Super members will have their full accounts automatically transferred to Prime Super and they will become members of the <em>HIP</em> division of Prime Super and share the same trustee &ndash; Prime Super Pty Ltd.</p>
<p><strong>#2 - What about Fees and costs?</strong><br />From 1 May 2014, HIP Super members will fall under the Prime Super fee structure. A full listing of our fees and costs are available in our <a href="/{localLink:1154}" title="Product disclosure statements">PDS</a>.</p>
<p><strong>#3 - What about insurance?</strong><br />Upon transfer, there will be no change to HIP Super members&rsquo; current insurance benefits.</p>
<p><strong>#4 - What about investment options?</strong><br />HIP investments will be closed on 30 April 2014 and member account balance will be transferred to the equivalent Prime Super investment option. From 1 May 2014, HIP members will receive a new Product Disclosure Statement from Prime Super with an investment switch form which members can complete to change their investment option and choose from one or a combination of Prime Super&rsquo;s nine investment options.</p>

        <mobileContent><![CDATA[<h2>Why is Super Important?</h2>
<p>Have you ever considered the kind of life you want to live when you retire from work? If you&rsquo;re like us, you&rsquo;ve just pictured yourself travelling through the great outdoors in a campervan or sitting on the balcony of a beach house in Spain.</p>
<p>But the thing is, the Age Pension won&rsquo;t provide this sort of retirement lifestyle on its own. You need to ensure you have savings to back-up any financial assistance you receive from the Government &ndash; and this is where super comes in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to consider super as early as possible and give yourself the best possible chance of turning your dreams for retirement, into a reality.</p>
<p>Here are a few things for you to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will need to have enough money to sustain you throughout your retirement. Today, people have a longer life expectancy than ever before. Depending on your age and health, your super payout may need to last for 20 years or more.</li>
<li>The standard Age Pension is probably not enough to sustain a good standard of living. And certainly not enough to fund any form of long distance travel on a regular basis.</li>
<li>You will only receive the Age Pension once you have reached the pensionable age of 65 for men and between 60 and 65 for women (this age is currently being adjusted to incorporate an increase). If you plan to retire before this age you will not be eligible for the Age Pension until you reach the required age.</li>
<li>As a general rule, for a comfortable retirement, you are likely to need a lump sum of $600,000 at age 65.*</li>
</ul>

          <summary><![CDATA[Save money on contributions, investments and withdrawals.]]></summary>
          <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Superannuation is one of the most effective ways of saving for your future, because your contributions are taxed at a much lower rate than most marginal tax rates.</p>
<h2>Super contributions</h2>
<p>Contributions to your Prime Super account are currently taxed at up to 15%, while marginal tax rates can be as high as 45% (plus an additional 2% Medicare levy and 2% for the next three financial years for the budget repair levy). The 15% rate also applies to any investment earnings made on your super account.</p>
<p>If your super is then taken as a lump sum or converted to a retirement income stream when you retire there are further tax concessions.</p>
<h2>Investment earnings</h2>
<p>Tax payable on investment earnings is deducted from the earnings for each of the Fund&rsquo;s investment options, before the earnings are credited to members&rsquo; accounts.</p>
<p>The tax rate on your investments will vary depending on the investment option you choose.</p>
<h2>Withdrawals</h2>
<p>Tax payable on super benefit payments (withdrawals) is deducted from the benefit before it is paid to a member.</p>
<p>Super withdrawals are divided into a tax&ndash;free component and a taxable component. The tax&ndash;free component consists of a contributions segment and a crystallised segment.</p>
<p>Generally, the contributions segment consists of contributions received by the Fund after 30 June 2007 that have not been included in the Fund&rsquo;s assessable income because they do not attract contributions tax.</p>
<p>The crystallised segment is made up of amounts that were not taxed or were lightly taxed under the pre-July 2007 rules.</p>
<p>Remember: If you withdraw your super benefit after the age of 60, it is tax-free. And if you open a retirement income stream, payments made after you reach age 60 are also tax-free.</p>
<h2>Tax on Death and Terminal Illness benefits</h2>
<p>If your lump sum Death benefit is paid to a person who is considered a dependant for tax purposes, the payment is tax-free.</p>
<p>If the benefit is paid to a non-dependant, tax is payable on the taxable component of the lump sum at 15%, plus the Medicare levy. This amount is deducted from the Death benefit before it is paid to the non-dependant.</p>
<p>All terminal illness benefits paid to members are tax-free.</p>
<h2>Additional benefits</h2>
<p>Additional tax benefits may include the following:</p>
<table border="0" style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 25%;"><strong>Salary sacrifice</strong></td>
<td style="width: 75%;">If you choose to add extra funds to your super (above the 9.5% contributed by your employer) the maximum amount of tax that you will pay on extra contributions is 15% up to the concessional contributions cap instead of your marginal tax rate.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Co-contributions</strong></td>
<td>If you earn less than $49,488 (2014-15) and make additional contributions to your super, the government could match 50% of your contribution (up to a maximum entitlement of $500).*</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Additional spouse contributions</strong></td>
<td>If your spouse earns less than $13,800 and you contribute to their super you could receive a tax rebate of up to $540. This can be done each year or when taking a lump sum.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Splitting your super with your spouse</strong></td>
<td>If you even out the super contributions between yourself and your spouse you may save tax when you convert your super into a pension.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Roll your super over into an allocated pension when you retire</strong></td>
<td>If you use your super to buy an allocated income stream rather than withdraw it, you can save tax on the lump sum. The returns on your allocated pension are not taxed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Access your super while you are still working</strong></td>
<td>If you are over 55 and working part time you can access your super in the form of a pre-retirement income stream and still contribute to your super.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Pension payments and withdrawals when you are over 60</strong></td>
<td>If you are 60 or over your income stream payments and lump sum withdrawals are not subject to tax.</td>
</tr>

          <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>We might go on a bit about the importance of super, but it&rsquo;s one of the largest assets you will accumulate in your lifetime so we feel it&rsquo;s our responsibility to encourage you to use it to your advantage.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Make regular personal savings</strong><br /><br />Even small, regular contributions could make a big difference to the end value of your super. Any contributions paid from after-tax income go straight into your account, where they are invested. There are no taxes payable on these contributions when you eventually withdraw you super.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Salary sacrifice your contributions and your tax at the same time</strong><br /><br />Salary sacrificing allows you to reduce your pre-tax salary by paying contributions into your super. This means that while increasing your super savings, you are also reducing the amount of your taxable income.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Roll in your other accounts and make your super simple</strong><br /><br />If you have other super savings, it makes sense to combine them into one account. It will save you time and money on unnecessary fees and charges incurred on your multiple super accounts.<br /><br />If you consolidate now, you can set yourself up for your working life and concentrate on adding to your super whenever you can.<br /><br />Provide your consent via our <a href="/{localLink:1340}" title="Fetch my super">Fetch My Super</a>&nbsp;tool and we will search for any super you have elsewhere then help you roll it in to your Prime Super account.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Let the Government help you with co-contributions</strong><br /><br />If you make personal super contributions you and earn less than $49,488 (2014-15) you could be eligible to receive up to $500 from the Government, which is paid to your Prime Super account.<br /><br />For up-to-date information about the income thresholds and matching rate <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/In-detail/Contributions/Super-co-contribution/?page=3#_Income_threshold__test" target="_blank">click here</a>&nbsp;or <a href="/{localLink:1106}" title="Contact us">contact us</a>.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Start super for your spouse and share the benefits</strong><br /><br />There are obvious benefits in contributing to your spouse&rsquo;s super, especially if their income is low or they are not working. Remember, even small amounts will make a difference over time.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Over 55? You can reduce your tax and boost your super at the same time</strong><br /><br />Take advantage of a transition to retirement strategy by reducing your working hours and using an income stream from your super to supplement your wages. You can also salary sacrifice more of your pay into super, which could reduce your tax and increase your super savings.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Find your lost super</strong><br /><br />The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super/In-detail/SuperSeeker/SuperSeeker/" target="_blank">ATO</a>&nbsp;keeps a register of people who have been reported by their super funds as being lost. This register is called the Lost Members Register (LMR).<br /><br />You may also be listed on the register as a lost member if one or more of your previous super funds:</li>
<ul>
<li>Has not had your current address and has had mail returned</li>
<li>Has not received contributions or a rollover for you in the past five years</li>
<li>Has received a roll-over for you and the fund reported you as a lost member</li>

        <mobileContent><![CDATA[<p>Super is one of the largest and most important assets you will accumulate in your lifetime. Here are some tips to help you use it to your advantage.</p>
<h2>7 Ways to Grow your Super</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Make regular personal savings</strong><br />No matter how small, regular contributions could make a big difference to the end value of your super.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Salary sacrifice your contributions and your tax at the same time</strong><br />Salary sacrificing allows you to reduce your pre-tax salary by paying contributions into your super. This means that you can increase your super savings, and reduce the amount of your taxable income at the same time.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Roll in your other accounts and simplify your super</strong> <br />If you have other super savings, it makes sense to combine them into one account. It will save you time and money on unnecessary fees and charges incurred on your multiple super accounts.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Let the Government help you with co-contributions</strong><br />If you make personal super contributions and earn less than $48,516 (2013-14) you could be eligible to receive up to $500 from the Government, paid to your Prime Super account.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Start super for your spouse and share the benefits</strong><br />There are obvious benefits in contributing to your spouse&rsquo;s super, especially if their income is low or they are not working.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Over 55? You can reduce your tax and boost your super at the same time</strong><br />Take advantage of a transition to retirement strategy by reducing your working hours and using an income stream from your super to supplement your wages.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Find your lost super</strong><br />The <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au/superfunds/" target="_blank">Australian Tax Office</a>&nbsp;keeps a register of people who have been reported by their super funds as being lost. If you need help with your lost super, simply <a href="/{localLink:1106}" title="Contact us">Contact Us</a>.<br /><br /></li>
</ol>
<h2>Tax Benefits of Super</h2>
<p>Superannuation is one of the most effective ways of saving for your future, because your contributions are taxed at a much lower rate than most marginal tax rates.</p>
<p><strong>Super contributions<br /></strong>Contributions to your Prime Super account are currently taxed at up to 15%, while marginal tax rates can be as high as 45%.</p>
<p><strong>Investment earnings<br /></strong>Tax payable on investment earnings is deducted from the earnings for each of the Fund&rsquo;s investment options, before the earnings are credited to members&rsquo; accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Income stream payments and withdrawals<br /></strong>When you reach the age of 60 your income stream payments and lump sum withdrawals are not subject to tax.</p>
<p><strong>Tax on Death and Terminal Illness Benefits<br /></strong>If your lump sum Death benefit is paid to a person who is considered a dependant for tax purposes, the payment is tax-free.</p>

            <summary><![CDATA[Industry super funds Prime Super and HIP have announced a commitment to merge effective 1 May 2014.]]></summary>
            <mainContent><![CDATA[<h3>New partnership for a stronger future</h3>
<p>Industry super funds Prime Super and HIP have announced a commitment to merge effective 1 May 2014.</p>
<p>After months of negotiations, Prime Super CEO Lachlan Baird and HIP CEO Ross Bernays have confirmed that they are close to formalising the merger of the two funds.</p>
<p>Both Baird and Bernays agree that the merger is great news for the members and employers of both funds as it positions the merged fund well for the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a larger fund,&rdquo; said Baird, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll gain further economies of scale; however we will not be so large that we will lose focus on what is important to our members and employers. We will continue to provide members and employers with the stability and service that they have come to expect, and we will also have the capacity for new and improved member and employer benefits and services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bernays agrees. &ldquo;Merging with Prime Super will ensure all members and employers benefit from greater economies of scale, with the aim of delivering improvements to the financial wellbeing of every one of our members.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bernays also stated that &ldquo;the HIP brand will continue, alongside Prime Super, after the merger to underline the continuity of focus on services to the health industry, and as recognition of the strong loyalty and connection that HIP has on its existing membership and employers."</p>
<p>Prime Super and HIP&rsquo;s customer-first focus makes for a good fit. Both funds are very much committed to providing their members with the best service and support in order to grow their retirement savings, while ensuring their employers have the right tools for managing their super obligations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this commitment to members and employers that will ensure our member&rsquo;s retirement savings remain in good hands and that the merged fund will continue to be successful into the future,&rdquo; said Bernays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re happy that we&rsquo;ve been able to find a super fund to partner with that has the same core values that we do,&rdquo; said Baird. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re also grateful to everyone that have worked together in a collegiate manner to create the opportunity for this new exciting strategic partnership. Rice Warner was engaged early on in the process to assist in the negotiations and design of the merged fund. The positive approach of all parties has led to a very progressive outcome that will create a strong and dynamic superannuation fund for all members and employers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The merger will be carried out as a Successor Fund Transfer with HIP member accounts scheduled to be transferred to Prime Super on 1 May 2014. From this date, HIP members will become members of the &ldquo;HIP Super&rdquo; division of Prime Super ABN 60 562 335 823 (merged fund). The Trustee of the merged fund will be Prime Super Pty Ltd.</p>
<p>Prime Super CEO Lachlan Baird will be the CEO of the merged fund while Ross Bernays, the current HIP CEO will be appointed the CIO of the merged fund. The composition of the trustee board will also change with four HIP Directors joining the five existing Directors from the Prime Super Board, ensuring that the ongoing representation and stewardship from the previous boards is maintained. Alan Bowman, the current independent Prime Super Chair will continue as Chair of the new combined Board.</p>]]></mainContent>

            <summary><![CDATA[We are pleased to announce that we have received approval from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) to launch a MySuper product from 1 July 2013.]]></summary>
            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>We are pleased to announce that we have received approval from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) to launch a MySuper product from 1 July 2013.</p>
<p>Prime Super CEO Lachlan Baird said the approval of the MySuper license is a signal that the Fund is well placed to tackle the growing demands on super funds in the new regulatory world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are extremely proud to be one of the first super funds to be granted a MySuper license,&rdquo; says Lachlan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is incredibly important for our registered employers. In the midst of quite a bit of superannuation change they&rsquo;ll have one less thing to worry about. Come 1 January 2014 they will automatically comply with the MySuper requirements without needing to do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>What is MySuper and how does it work?</h3>
<p>MySuper &ndash; a low cost super product designed specifically for disengaged members - is just one part of the Federal Government&rsquo;s broader Stronger Super reforms.</p>
<p>When an employee starts a new job, if they do not choose a super fund, their employer must have a super fund in which to pay that employee&rsquo;s super contributions. This is called a default fund.</p>
<p>From 1 January 2014, when a choice has not been made by a member/employee, employer contributions will have to go into an approved MySuper product.</p>
<p>As Prime Super has already been granted a MySuper licence and will offer a MySuper product from 1 July 2013, all employers who use Prime Super as their default fund will automatically comply with the MySuper rules from 1 January 2014 without needing to do anything.</p>]]></mainContent>

<p><br />✔ Temporary Residents If you employ temporary Australian residents who meet any of the above conditions you must make super contributions for them.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>On the 8th of May 2012, the federal government delivered its 2012-13 budget. The nation had been forewarned that Wayne Swan&rsquo;s primary objective was the get the budget back to surplus. So although disappointing, it came as no real surprise that the changes to super were all about saving money.</p>
<p>A brief summary of the changes are provided below. If you&rsquo;d like more information about any of the changes, please contact Rod Stewart, your Prime Super Regional Manager or visit <a href="http://www.budget.gov.au" target="_blank">www.budget.gov.au</a>.</p>
<h3>Concessional contributions cap of $25,000 to apply to all individuals for 2012-13 &amp; 2013-14</h3>
<p>You may be aware that the government limits the amount of money you can contribute to your super account at favourable tax rates. This is known as the concessional contributions cap.</p>
<p>In last year&rsquo;s budget, the government announced that from 1 July 2012, it would increase the amount over 50&rsquo;s could contribute pre-tax from $25,000 to $50,000 if they had less than $500,000 in super.</p>
<p>However in this year&rsquo;s budget the government announced that it would defer this increase for two years.</p>
<p>This means that the concessional contributions cap of $25,000 will apply to everyone, no matter their age, for the 2012-13 and 2013-14 financial years.</p>
<h3>Superannuation contributions tax increase for high income earners</h3>
<p>If you make contributions into your super account from your pre-tax salary, those contributions (up to the concessional contributions cap we mentioned above) are subject to a 15% contributions tax. For many working Australians this is much lower than their marginal tax rate and one of the reasons salary-sacrificing into super is an attractive savings vehicle for many.</p>
<p>From 1 July 2012, the government wants to double the contributions tax rate for high income earners.</p>
<p>This will now mean that if you earn more than $300,000, the tax you will pay on your pre-tax contributions will double from 15% to 30%.</p>
<h3>Other proposed super changes to be aware of</h3>
<h4>Increase in the SG</h4>
<p>From 1 July 2013, the SG rate will increase from 9 to 9.25%. It will continue to increase incrementally until it reaches 12% on 1 July 2019.</p>
<h4>Removal of SG age limit</h4>
<p>From 1 July 2013, the SG age limit will be removed and employers will be required to make SG contributions for all eligible employees aged 70 years and older.</p>
<h4>Concessional cap indexation paused for 2013-14</h4>
<p>The government will pause indexation of the superannuation general concessional contributions cap for one year in 2013-14, so it remains at $25,000.</p>
<p>Indexation of the cap will be deferred until 2014-15, when the cap is expected to rise to $30,000.</p>
<p>Indexation of the non-concessional contributions cap will also be paused.</p>
<h4>Low income super contribution</h4>
<p>From 1 July 2012, the government plans to provide a new super contribution tax rebate of up to $500 annually on concessional contributions for people with adjustable taxable incomes of up to $37,000.</p>
<p>To be eligible, individuals will need to meet a test where at least 10% of their income must be from employment or business sources and they are a resident of Australia or New Zealand.</p>]]></mainContent>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>According to the Association of Superannuation Funds&rsquo; Retirement Standard we will need a lump sum of around $650,000 at age 65 to be comfortable in retirement.</p>
<p>Sadly, not many of us are on track to achieve this when we retire.</p>
<p>But the good news is that the numbers show that contributing a little bit extra to your super, above what your employer contributes, while you&rsquo;re working can make a big difference to your final balance when you retire.</p>
<p>So this Easter as you enjoy what's left of your chocolate eggs, consider investing a little extra into your retirement nest egg.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve made the decision to make voluntary contributions to your super, the next step is figure out what type of contribution to make and then how to make it.</p>
<p>The second part &ndash; how to make a contribution - is pretty easy. Most super funds accept contributions via BPAY or credit card so you don&rsquo;t have to do anything more than log on to your online super account. Alternatively you can also send your super fund a cheque.</p>
<p>When it comes to the types of contributions, there&rsquo;s a little more you need to know to make sure you get the most for your money and you don&rsquo;t get into trouble with the tax man.</p>
<h3>Types of contributions</h3>
<p><strong>Employer SG contributions</strong> &ndash; These are regular contributions that if you&rsquo;re eligible, your employer must make on your behalf to your super fund. The current SG rate is 9 percent. However it will increase to 9.25 next year (2012-13) and then by half a percent each year until it reaches 12 percent in 2019-20.</p>
<p>Your payslip should provide details of the SG payments your employer has made to your super fund. You can also check with your super fund to ensure that your contributions are being made. If they haven&rsquo;t, you should speak to your employer or contact the Tax Office.</p>
<p><strong>After-tax contributions</strong> &ndash; Also called non-concessional contributions, these are contributions that you make from your after-tax income. You can make these contributions directly to your super account or you can request that your employer does this for you each time you are paid.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, if you make voluntary after-tax contributions to your super, you may be entitled to a government co-contribution. That&rsquo;s free money from the government to help you in retirement.</p>
<p>The amount of the co-contribution you receive will depend on your income and the amount of personal contributions you make. So the more you pay in up to the maximum co-contribution threshold the more you will receive from the Government. For more information on the co-contribution contact your super fund or the Australian Tax Office.</p>
<p><strong>Before-tax contributions</strong> &ndash; These are contributions that you make to your super account from your before-tax income. They are also called concessional contributions because they receive concessional tax treatment. This means they are taxed at 15 percent (the same as employer SG contributions) rather than your marginal tax rate so there can be some tax advantages to contributing to super from before-tax income.</p>
<p>To make before-tax contributions to your super, you must enter into a formal salary sacrifice arrangement with your employer, whereby you agree to give up part of your pre-tax salary in return for your employer contributing the same amount into your super account.</p>
<h3>Contribution caps</h3>
<p>As with most things, the government has placed limits (or caps) on the amount of contributions you can make before and after tax. It&rsquo;s important that you are aware of the caps because there are hefty tax penalties if you breach them.</p>
<p><strong>Concessional contributions cap</strong> &ndash; The concessional contributions cap for the current financial year (2011-12) is $25,000. However for those aged 50 or over, the limit is $50,000. This may eventually reduce to $25,000 in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Non-concessional contributions cap</strong> &ndash; The non-concessional contributions cap for 2011-12 is $150,000. However people under 65 years old are able to make after-tax contributions of up to three times the cap over a three-year period. This is known as the 'bring-forward' option and means they can contribute up to $450,000 in any one year.</p>
<h3>What happens if I exceed the caps?</h3>
<p>If you make contributions in excess of the caps, you will have to pay additional tax. See the ATO website for details of the tax penalties associated with breaching the caps.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>The world of investing can be quite complex and difficult to understand. Whilst there are professionals you can talk to about the best investment strategy for your personal circumstances it&rsquo;s worthwhile knowing some of the basics.</p>
<p>Prime Super&rsquo;s financial planner, Marcus Biggs, helps us out.</p>
<h3>What is an investment portfolio?</h3>
<p>Your investment portfolio refers to the types of investments your total financial assets&nbsp;are invested in. For many people, their largest lifestyle asset is their family home, and their largest investment asset is their superannuation or investment property. They may also have other savings in shares, term deposits and bank accounts.</p>
<h3>What are asset classes?</h3>
<p>The four main asset classes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cash (e.g. bank accounts)</li>
<li>Fixed interest (e.g. government bonds, corporate bonds)</li>
<li>Property (e.g. residential, commercial, industrial)</li>
<li>Shares (e.g. Australian &amp; International shares)</li>
</ul>
<p>Asset classes can broadly be separated into &lsquo;defensive&rsquo; and &lsquo;growth&rsquo; investments:</p>
<h3>Defensive investments (cash and fixed interest)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Provide regular income and do not usually grow in capital value.</li>
<li>Investment returns and values fluctuate only slightly over short periods.</li>
<li>Over the medium to long-term, returns are generally lower than those of growth investments.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Growth investments (property and shares)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can provide growth in the value of your capital in addition to income.</li>
<li>Investment returns can fluctuate significantly over short periods although over the medium to long-term, returns are potentially higher than those of defensive investments. However it&rsquo;s important to note that returns may be negative over a short period.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risk and Return</h3>
<p>Both &lsquo;Defensive&rsquo; and &lsquo;Growth&rsquo; investments have a different expected rate of return, and normally, the higher the expected return, the higher the associated risk.</p>
<p>All investments carry some risk. There are broadly three types of risk to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>The likelihood of not getting the expected return on the investment you are considering &ndash; including the possibility of losing some or all of your investment</li>
<li>The risk of volatility &ndash; where the value of some investments and their potential return may rise or fall from time to time due to market fluctuations</li>
<li>The risk of being too cautious &ndash; if your money earns less than inflation then it loses its real purchasing power</li>
</ol>
<p>These risks can generally be managed by assessing the investment you are considering and your own long-term financial situation and objectives.</p>
<p>We would normally expect that the more aggressively you invest, the more likely it is that you will achieve higher long term returns, but you also run the risk of short- term setbacks, as occurred in 2008-2009.</p>
<h3>Diversification</h3>
<p>By not investing all your funds into the one investment, or even the one asset class, you can significantly reduce the level of fluctuations in your investment value; that is, &lsquo;not putting all of your eggs in the one basket&rsquo;. This type of investment approach is known as diversification.</p>
<p>Diversification is not simply throwing your money around haphazardly into as many different investments as you can. It is about selecting investments that complement each other, and perform well at different times of the economic cycle.</p>
<p>Knowing how much to invest in each asset class will depend on your personal circumstances, objectives, investment time frame and risk profile.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<h2>Important information: We're changing administrators</h2>
<p>During the past financial year Prime Super undertook an external market review of the administration function of the Fund, and made the important decision to change administrators. We have appointed Russell Employee Benefits Pty Ltd (&ldquo;Russell&rdquo;) as administrator to the Fund effective 1 January 2012.</p>
<p>Russell is part of Russell Investments, an independent, global financial services firm that provides strategic advice, investment solutions and implementation services to institutional investors, financial advisors and individuals.</p>
<p>Our move to Russell from our existing administrator, Pillar Administration, will allow us to further strengthen our member and employer services, and introduce some exciting new features.</p>
<p>These new features include intra-fund financial planning for members wanting to discuss investment and contribution strategies or insurance options; and a more comprehensive member education program.</p>
<h3>What&rsquo;s an Administrator?</h3>
<p>Most super funds outsource the administration of member accounts to an administration company, to access greater scale, improve efficiencies and help keep costs down. At Prime Super, our administrator handles all of the day-to-day operations of the Fund including receiving and opening mail, running the call centre, administering and processing contributions and benefits, hosting our secure online services and administering components of our insurance claims.</p>
<p>We work closely with our administrator on a daily basis and have agreed service standards to ensure that our members and employers receive the best possible customer service.</p>
<h3>Why the change?</h3>
<p>We feel that the additional services and technological edge offered by Russell is vital in assisting us to continue to provide our members with innovative products and improved services at a competitive price.</p>
<h3>What does this mean for you?</h3>
<h4>Members</h4>
<p>The change in administrator will not affect your Prime Super account however we expect the service you receive through Russell will be more responsive.</p>
<p>If you are registered for online services, you may notice a change to our site&rsquo;s look and feel. There also may be a period during the transition where your account information may not be available to view online. If this happens, it will only be for a brief time and we will be sure to advise you well in advance of any disruption.</p>
<p>Moving forward, there are a number of exciting new initiatives that we&rsquo;ll be able to implement once the transition is complete and we look forward to introducing these to you during 2012.</p>
<h4>Employers</h4>
<p>As with members, the change in administrator should improve the service you receive from us. We are working towards a smooth transition from Pillar to Russell and there will be very little, if any, disruption for employers. If there is to be a service or processing black-out period, we will advise you of the date and the length of the &lsquo;black- out&rsquo; period well in advance.</p>
<p>If you pay your Superannuation Guarantee (SG) contributions online it is likely you&rsquo;ll notice some minor changes to the look and feel of the secure site but all else will remain as it was - that is, our phone number, web address, and email address will all remain the same.</p>
<h3>Questions or concerns?</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got any questions or concerns about the transition, please contact your Regional Manager or our customer service centre on 1800 675 839.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Your annual statement is now available]]></title>
            <summary><![CDATA[Your annual benefit statement for the year ending 30 June 2011 will be mailed to you this week.]]></summary>
            <mainContent><![CDATA[<div class="moduleCtaList">
<p><strong>Your annual benefit statement for the year ending 30 June 2011 will be mailed to you this week.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you're registerd for online services, you can also check your statement online. Simply <a href="http://www.primesuper.com.au/My-Account-Access.html" target="_blank">log in</a> to your account.</strong></p>
</div>
<h3>Your 6 questions you should ask yourself when your benefit statement arrives</h3>
<p><strong>1. Did you receive more than one statement?</strong></p>
<p>If you received more than one super statement it means you have more than one super account and could be paying unnecessary fees. If you do have more than one super account it&rsquo;s worth consolidating them into one. This way you&rsquo;ll stop paying multiple fees and your super will have a higher base from which to grow.</p>
<p><strong>2. What&rsquo;s your account balance? Have your SG contributions been paid by your employer?</strong></p>
<p>Check your account balance and transaction listing. Your account balance will show you how much you&rsquo;ve got in super while your transaction listing will show you all the super your employer has contributed (including any salary sacrifice and voluntary contributions you may have made) during the last financial year.</p>
<p>If your employer hasn&rsquo;t paid your super entitlements or you think the amount is incorrect make sure you speak to them as soon as possible to get it sorted.</p>
<p>Step one is to speak to your employer to clarify how much super you&rsquo;re entitled to and when it should have been paid into your super account. If you get an unsatisfactory answer from your employer you should lodge an enquiry about unpaid super with the Tax Office.</p>
<p><strong>3. How much insurance cover do you have?</strong></p>
<p>Insurance cover &ndash; death, TPD and income protection are an important element of your super, yet some people are unaware of their level of cover or that they even have insurance at all. When you get your statement you should review your level of cover.</p>
<p>You may find that if it&rsquo;s been awhile since you&rsquo;ve checked you may need to increase your level of cover.</p>
<p><strong>4. Where is your money invested?</strong></p>
<p>The majority of Australians have their super invested in their super fund&rsquo;s balanced investment option. While this may be fine for most, it&rsquo;s worth reviewing your investment options to see if there&rsquo;s another option better suited to your investment horizon and risk profile.</p>
<p><strong>5. Have you nominated a beneficiary?</strong></p>
<p>If you have it will be listed on your account summary. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for people to nominate a beneficiary when they first open their super account and then forget about it. If your personal circumstances have changed since you first nominated a beneficiary (you might have gotten married, divorced or had children) it&rsquo;s a good idea to check and update your nomination so that the people you want to receive your benefit when you die are not left out in the cold.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t nominated a beneficiary at all, it&rsquo;s a good idea to have a think about who you would like to receive your benefit once you pass away. It&rsquo;s also important to remember that the purpose of your super is to provide for you in retirement and for your dependants when you pass away.</p>
<p><strong>6. How much are you paying in fees?</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to check how much you&rsquo;re paying in fees to ensure that your super isn&rsquo;t being eroded by fees. We&rsquo;ve all seen the industry super fund television commercials that show the difference that fees can make to your final super balance. So if you think you&rsquo;re paying too much in fees it&rsquo;s worth shopping around for some less expensive options.</p>]]></mainContent>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>The Global Financial Crisis was a tough time for investors and we are continuing to feel its affects now. Right now there is increased uncertainty and we are experiencing another period of volatility and unfavourable market conditions.</p>
<p>Turn on the news or pick up a newspaper and the headlines all appear to be the same &ndash; share markets around the world are in free-fall wiping off millions and billions of dollars each day. Various news programs and financial commentators are predicting a return to doom and gloom with terms like &lsquo;GFC Mark II&rsquo;, &lsquo;double-dip recessions&rsquo; and &lsquo;sovereign debt crisis turned bankruptcy&rsquo; being used on a daily basis.</p>
<p>All of this negativity does nothing for investor confidence and can make the stock market feel like a scary place to have one&rsquo;s super invested.</p>
<h3>What does all of this mean for your super?</h3>
<p>Although it can be hard, it&rsquo;s important for super investors to take the emotion out of investing. History shows that stock markets have risen and fallen, sometimes quite dramatically, over the short-term. All superannuation members should remember that super is a long-term investment. Of course no-one likes to think they&rsquo;re losing money, but despite all the doom and gloom in the markets at the moment, the only time you actually lose money is if you take your money out of super (via a benefit withdrawal) or you switch investment options. Other losses are just on paper and as history also shows, expected to be regained over time. Although a hard thing to do, sometimes doing nothing can be better that doing something.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re unsure or uncomfortable with what&rsquo;s happening to your super, you should strongly consider speaking to a financial planner about your options. Please <a href="/{localLink:1278}" title="General Enquiries">contact us</a> if you would like to speak to our financial planner.*</p>
<h3>What about me? I&rsquo;m about to retire &ndash; my losses are real</h3>
<p>The only time your losses are realised are if you cash out and take your benefit as a lump sum. You do have other options when you retire that allow you to keep your money invested in the super system. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re 65 and want to retire next month. Instead of taking your benefit as a lump sum and permanently crystallising your losses, you can transfer your Prime Super benefit to a Prime Super retirement income stream and receive regular payments from it in retirement whilst the bulk of your money remains invested, and can benefit at a time that markets recover. You may lose some value if you change investment options when you open your income stream, but if you live to 80, you&rsquo;ll have another 15 years of investment to recover and participate in any gains the market may contribute over that time.</p>
<p>Of course everyone&rsquo;s situation is different so it&rsquo;s important to speak to a financial planner before making an important investment decision.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Sally and John Smith are a hard-working baby boomer couple in their late 50&rsquo;s. For many years their priority was their family, in particular paying off the family home. Now that they own their home and their kids are starting their own families, Sally and John are thinking about retirement. They don&rsquo;t want much &ndash; just to be able to spend quality time with their grandkids, go on holiday every couple of years and, have the ability to continue to do all the social things they currently do.</p>
<p>They know they can&rsquo;t maintain their lifestyle on the aged pension alone, and with relatively small super balances, the big question for them is when can they afford to retire?</p>
<h3>Starting late in life</h3>
<p>Unfortunately many baby boomers generally only started accumulating super when 3% compulsory super was introduced in 1992. Before then superannuation was optional and had to be funded by the individual. With mortgages and alarmingly high interest rates, it&rsquo;s not surprising that many people put any extra savings into their homes rather than their super.</p>
<p>And despite the increase in the super guarantee to 9% in 2002, many still didn&rsquo;t contribute any extra to their super. This means that many baby boomers are unlikely to have enough in super now to fund the lifestyle they&rsquo;ve become accustomed to when they reach retirement.</p>
<h3>How much is enough?</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s generally accepted that you&rsquo;ll need 65% of your pre-retirement income in retirement. Of course you may need more or less depending on your personal circumstances.</p>
<p>To help you determine how much you&rsquo;ll need in retirement you should prepare a budget that takes into account your desired lifestyle, goals, objectives and life expectancy. If you want to be able to travel overseas every couple of years, you&rsquo;ll probably need more money in retirement than someone who is happy to caravan around Australia for a couple of months a year.</p>
<p>Another good source of information to help you determine how much you&rsquo;ll need in retirement is the Westpac/ASFA Retirement Standard which looks at the spending habits of current retirees. This will give you an estimate of the annual budget needed to fund either a comfortable or modest lifestyle in retirement.</p>
<p>The most recent Retirement Standard shows that, in general, a couple looking to achieve a comfortable retirement needs to spend $54,562 a year, while those seeking a modest (think better than the Age Pension but still only able to afford fairly basic activities) retirement lifestyle need to spend $31,263 a year.</p>
<p>We now know that investing a little time and money into super can pay dividends when you finally retire. But all is not lost if you haven&rsquo;t been able to do this. Contributing to your super in the few years leading up to retirement can still have a beneficial effect on your account balance when you retire.</p>
<h3>It&rsquo;s never too late to boost your super savings.</h3>
<p>It might be a clich&eacute; but in this case it&rsquo;s very true &ndash; it&rsquo;s never too late to top up your super.</p>
<p><strong>Make extra contributions</strong> &ndash; every little helps: Super fund members can make contributions to their super from before and after-tax money, however the government limits the amount of contributions you can make in any given year.</p>
<p>Before-tax contributions are called concessional contributions. These contributions are made with before-tax money (think employer super guarantee contributions and salary sacrifice contributions) and are taxed in your fund at 15% instead of your marginal tax rate. The cap on concessional contributions is currently $25,000 a year. However if you are aged 50 years or over, an increased concessional contributions cap of $50,000 applies until 30 June 2012.</p>
<p>The government has also announced changes to the concessional contributions cap to help older Australians increase their retirement savings. If passed by parliament, the concessional contributions cap will permanently remain at $50,000 for individuals aged 50 years or over with super balances below $500,000. <br /> <br />After-tax contributions are called non-concessional contributions. Because you have already paid tax on these contributions, they are not taxed when they are put into, or taken out of your super account.</p>
<p>The current non-concessional contributions cap is $150,000. However if you are aged under 65 years old, you may be able to make non-concessional contributions of up to three times the cap over a three-year period. This is known as the 'bring-forward' option. The bring-forward cap is three times the non-concessional contributions cap of the first year. So if you brought forward your contributions in 11-12, it would be $450,000 (3 x $150,000).</p>
<p><strong>Top up your spouse&rsquo;s super</strong> - If your spouse earns more than you do, they can help boost your account balance by splitting certain super contributions with you. The ATO limits the types of contributions and the amount you can split with your spouse so check their website for the current thresholds. www.ato.gov.au/super</p>
<p>If you or your spouse earns less than $13,800 a year, and you make contributions to their super account, you may be able to claim an 18% tax offset on contributions up to $3,000.</p>
<p><strong>Take advantage of a government co-contributions</strong> - As an incentive to get people thinking about their super, the government will dollar match all after-tax contributions you make to your super fund up to a maximum of $1,000. So if you earn less than $61,920 a year you could be eligible to receive up to $1,000 in super contributions from the Government. The amount of the co-contribution you receive will depend on your income and the amount you have paid as a personal contribution to your super fund.</p>
<p><strong>Transition to retirement (TTR)</strong> - A transition to retirement strategy is a great option if you want to cut down the hours you work without sacrificing your salary. A transition to retirement income stream allows you to access your super while you&rsquo;re still working as long as you've reached your preservation age.</p>
<p>To start a TTR income stream you must first roll the money in your super account into a TTR income stream. Once you've done that, you can start receiving regular payments from your super.</p>
<p>This means that you can reduce the hours you work without sacrificing your lifestyle since your salary is supplemented by regular payments from your income stream.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can continue to work full-time and use the additional income to enjoy life's luxuries. Or you could reap the tax benefits of salary sacrificing more of your wage into super (effectively paying the 15% contributions tax rather than your tax-rate) and continue to build your retirement nest egg.</p>
<p><strong>Seek professional help</strong> - As with most things in life, it pays to speak to a professional. An independent financial planner will sit down with you, help you define your retirement goals and provide you with strategies to help you reach those goals.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>The humble con-artist is nothing if not adaptable. It used to be that they targeted trusting and vulnerable consumers by selling things that were &lsquo;too good to true&rsquo; and vanishing without a trace before the purchaser finally figured out that they had been duped. Then they posed as Nigerian royalty promising us thousands of dollars for helping them smuggle money out of Nigeria.</p>
<p>But in this new technological age, con-artists have also come of age. These scammers can now target hoards of people all over the world via the internet and mobile phones without having to leave the comfort of their home.</p>
<p>And the modern-day scammer has also upped the ante. They&rsquo;re no longer content with just getting you to fork out a couple of dollars for a useless product or service. They&rsquo;re after something much more valuable &ndash; your identity.</p>
<h3>Our personal information is everywhere</h3>
<p>We all carry around a massive amount of personal information with us each day. Take a look in your wallet, I bet you&rsquo;ve got a drivers licence, ATM and/or credit card and a Medicare card. With just those few cards someone has access to your name, address, date of birth, Medicare number and banking details.</p>
<p>But modern day identity thieves don&rsquo;t just have to steal your wallet to steal your identity, they can get your personal details through your mail (either by stealing it or going through the mail you throw away), online (think about the personal details you have saved to your Facebook or MySpace account) or you might even give it to them inadvertently over the internet or over the phone.</p>
<p>Identity fraud scams are becoming increasing sophisticated as fraudsters &lsquo;phish&rsquo; (pronounced fish) for your personal information. There are three types of phishing &ndash; regular phishing (email scams), vishing (phone scams) and smishing (SMS scams).</p>
<p>Some of the most popular scams involve the fraudster calling, SMS-ing or sending their victims an email that claims to be from their financial institution and asking victims to verify (by return email or over the phone (to a fake phone number) their account details and sometimes even their PIN or internet banking password. They often talk of &lsquo;security and maintenance upgrades&rsquo;, investigation of &lsquo;irregularities&rsquo; or &lsquo;bills or charges woes&rsquo;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to remember that no financial institution will ever ask you to provide those kinds of details via email, phone or SMS. So if you do get a letter, email, phone call or SMS that&rsquo;s a bit &lsquo;fishy&rsquo; the best thing you can do is delete the email or SMS, hang up the phone or throw the letter in the bin.</p>
<h3>You can protect yourself</h3>
<p>The best way to protect yourself from these thieves is to make sure you protect your personal information.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s MoneySmart website has some great tips for protecting your personal info. Here are 10 of the best.</p>
<ul>
<li>Never give your personal details to people you don't know. If you receive a call from someone claiming to be from your bank or any other organisation, don't give them your details. Instead tell them you&rsquo;ll call the organisation in question to check it is really them calling. Also never click on a link or call a phone number in an email &ndash; type the address into your browser and use a phone directory to look up the correct number.</li>
<li>Check your bank and super statements. If you see any suspect transactions, contact your bank, credit card provider or super fund immediately.Destroy personal information before you throw it away. Shred or cut up your bills, statements and expired cards to prevent thieves from using them.</li>
<li>Lock your letter box. Secure your letter box with a lock and collect your mail regularly. If you notice mail missing contact your providers or the post office.</li>
<li>Protect your mobile or smartphone. Be wary when installing applications onto your phone. Scammers may send you applications designed to download malicious software onto your phone and steal bank account details.</li>
<li>Be careful what information you give on social networking sites like Facebook. Identity thieves trawl sites like Facebook and Twitter for personal details they can use. If you have a Facebook account it&rsquo;s also a good idea to make sure your account is set to private so that only your friends can see your personal information.</li>
<li>Disable pop-ups on your browser. Fraudsters can use pop-ups to install programs on your computer that 'spy' on you or record your key strokes. This is how they find out passwords to your bank and other accounts. If you can&rsquo;t disable them, don&rsquo;t click on them.</li>
<li>Make your passwords hard to guess. Use a combination of numbers and letters and change your passwords frequently. And whatever you do, don&rsquo;t store your passwords on your computer or mobile phone.</li>
<li>Install up-to-date anti-virus software. It will automatically prevent, detect and remove any suspicious programs from your computer.</li>
<li>Log out of websites and email accounts. This is especially important with internet banking. If you don't log out, anyone can access your details and your money.</li>
</ul>
<p>And lastly remember, if an email, phone call or letter offers you something that&rsquo;s too good to be true, it probably is!</p>

<div class="moduleCtaList">
<h3>A growing and costly problem in Australia</h3>
<p>Identity fraud is a big problem in Australia and sadly it&rsquo;s on the rise. A 2007 Australian Bureau of Statistics survey on personal fraud found that half a million Australians had experienced some form of identity fraud in the preceding year. According to a report commissioned by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre, identity fraud cost the Australian community $1.1 billion dollars in 2001/2002.</p>
<h3>So what exactly is identity fraud?</h3>
<p>Identity fraud is when someone (most likely a criminal) uses another person&rsquo;s identity to interact with banks, businesses and government agencies. And given that these fraudsters aren&rsquo;t prepared to use their own name gives you some idea of what kinds of activities they&rsquo;re likely to use your identity for.</p>
<p>Many identity thieves will use their new identities to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a credit card account in your name and rack up huge debts</li>
<li>Open a bank account in your name and issue bad cheques</li>
<li>Take out a loan in your name that they have no intention of paying back</li>
<li>Use your name to buy a mobile phone and rack up huge bills</li>
</ul>
<p>Sadly, by the time you realise what&rsquo;s happened, it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<h3>How will I know if someone is pretending to be me?</h3>
<p>If you start receiving bills, credit card statements, loan statements or calls from creditors that you know nothing about, it&rsquo;s a pretty good indication that something is not right. You may also notice a reduction in the amount of mail you receive. This could mean that your mail is being stolen or being redirected to another address.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>While there are many perks to being self employed one downfall is that there is no one to make automatic payments into your chosen super fund for you. The responsibility of funding your retirement rests entirely with you.</p>
<p>Research by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA) shows that a large number of self-employed Australians have little or no super, and no other retirement savings.</p>
<p>According to ASFA, although self-employed people comprise over 10% of the paid labour force, they have relatively low levels of super. Around 26% have no super, while a further 53% have super balances of less than $40,000.</p>
<p>Many self-employed people believe the sale of their business will fund their retirement but while this may work for some, the recent GFC has shown that it&rsquo;s not always a fail proof method. Life can throw up the unexpected and if this means you are unable to sell your business when and how you planned or for the price you were expecting, your retirement dreams may be thrown into disarray.</p>
<p>Making regular super contributions throughout your working life while self-employed can give you the peace of mind of knowing you&rsquo;ll have enough money to see yourself through retirement irrespective of a smooth and profitable business sale.</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;re self-employed and unsure about super, here are some things to consider.</p>
<h3>Tax deductions</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re under 75, you may be able to claim a tax deduction for contributions you make into your account. To be eligible you must earn less than 10% of your total income from employment as someone else&rsquo;s employee. If you&rsquo;re under 50 you can claim a full deduction for contributions up to $25,000. If aged 50 or over you can claim up to $50,000.</p>
<h3>How do I claim a tax deduction?</h3>
<p>If you intend to claim a tax deduction on your self employed contributions you will need to complete a Deduction for personal super contributions form (NAT 71121). This is an ATO form that you&rsquo;ll need to complete each year to let your super fund know which contributions you want to claim a tax deduction for. You can either download this form from the ATO website <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au" target="_blank">www.ato.gov.au</a> or ask your super fund to send you a copy.</p>
<h3>I own a company. Am I eligible?</h3>
<p>If you own a company, super contributions made by the company are treated as employer contributions, so will usually be eligible as tax deductions for the company. Check with your accountant or the ATO if you have further questions.</p>
<h3>What happens if I don&rsquo;t claim a tax deduction?</h3>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t claim your contributions as a tax deduction they will be regarded as voluntary contributions. If this is the case, and you are eligible, you may also be eligible for a Government co-contribution.</p>
<h3>What about insurance?</h3>
<p>Another important thing to consider if you are self-employed is how your income and livelihood might suffer if you are unable to work due to illness or injury.</p>
<p>Most super funds offer death, terminal and permanent disability and income protection insurance. There are also a number of benefits if you take out insurance cover through your super fund. Firstly, and perhaps most importantly for your back pocket, your premiums are deducted directly from your super fund member account. This means it&rsquo;s more tax effective as premiums don&rsquo;t come out of your disposable income.</p>
<p>Plus because super funds buy cover for all members, they get bulk discount rates from their insurer so you receive the benefit of scale. This means that the premiums you pay for the cover through your super fund are generally cheaper than the rate you could get outside super. It also means that in most cases you can afford a higher more appropriate level of cover through your super fund for the same price of reduced cover through a retail insurer.</p>]]></mainContent>

            <title><![CDATA[Flood Levy - Important Information for Members]]></title>
            <summary><![CDATA[Important information for Prime Super members regarding the temporary flood levy.]]></summary>
            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>he Government has introduced a temporary flood levy for the 2011-12 financial year to help with the rebuilding of flood-affected regions across Australia. The levy will apply to all Australians with a taxable income of more than $50,000 in the 2011-12 financial year. The amount of extra tax you&rsquo;ll be required to pay will depend on your income and is detailed below.</p>
<table border="1" class="dataTable">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Taxable income</strong></td>
<td><strong>Flood levy on this income</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$0 to $50,000</td>
<td>Nil</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>$50,001 to $100,000</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Over $100,000</td>
<td>$250 + 1% of amount over $100,000</td>

</table>
<h3>People affected by the floods will be exempt from the levy</h3>
<p>Anyone who earns over $50,000 but who has also received an Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment or is a New Zealand citizen who has received an ex-gratia payment from Centrelink before June 30 2012 for a natural disaster that occurred in the period 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011 will be exempt from paying the levy.</p>
<p>If you are exempt from paying the levy you should complete the <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au/businesses/content.aspx?doc=/content/00280175.htm" target="_blank">Flood levy exemption declaration form</a> (NAT 73797) and it to your employer. It you are exempt and forget to fill in the form, any extra tax you pay will be refunded to you when you lodge your tax return.<br /> <br />The <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au/businesses/content.aspx?doc=/content/00280175.htm" target="_blank">Flood levy exemption declaration form</a> may be mailed to you by the ATO but will also be available at newsagencies, on the ATO <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au/" target="_blank">website</a>, or from the ATO ordering service (please call 1300 720 092).</p>
<h3>Superannuation lump sum payments are not exempt from the levy...</h3>
<p>The flood levy will be applied to all lump sum payments to members under age 60 if the payment has a taxable component over $50,000. This is regardless of whether your benefit has a zero rate of tax because for tax purposes, this amount is considered taxable income by the government.</p>
<h3>...neither are income stream payments</h3>
<p>If the taxable portion of your Prime Super income stream payments exceeds $50,000 in the 2011-12 financial year, then the flood levy will automatically be included in the tax withheld from your income stream payments by Prime Super.</p>
<p>However, if you are to receive a lump sum or income stream payments are you are exempt from paying the flood levy, you should complete the <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au/businesses/content.aspx?doc=/content/00280175.htm" target="_blank">Flood levy exemption form</a> and send it back to us.</p>
<p>If the flood levy is applied to your income stream and the ATO finds that you are exempt, then the tax withheld for the levy will be refunded to you by the ATO after you lodge your 2011-12 tax return.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Sam started a new job last week. He arrived on his first day and was given a stack of papers by his new employer. He takes them home and fills in the important ones - the bank details form and the tax file number declaration. There&rsquo;s one in there about superannuation but he doesn&rsquo;t really pay any attention to it &ndash; he doesn&rsquo;t want to rock the boat and is happy to have his super paid to his employer&rsquo;s default super fund.</p>
<p>If this was Sam&rsquo;s first job he&rsquo;d have nothing to worry about. But it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s his fourth and assuming he did exactly the same thing for his previous jobs, it&rsquo;s likely he now has four different super fund accounts.</p>
<p>If this scenario sounds familiar to you you&rsquo;re not alone. The majority of working Australians have more than one super account. In fact a CHOICE study on super found that in 2008 there were almost 32 million super accounts and only 10.7 million workers. When you do the maths it works out to around 3 super accounts per person.<br /> <br />What most people forget (or don&rsquo;t know) is that: a) it&rsquo;s better in the long run to have just one super account, and b) that just because you change jobs doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to change super funds.</p>
<h3>Starting a new job &ndash; your rights and entitlements</h3>
<p>Most Australian workers are entitled to choose where they would like their super contributions to be paid. When you start your new job, if you do want your super to be paid into a particular fund, all you have to do is give your employer the details of your chosen super fund together with a copy of your fund&rsquo;s letter of compliance.</p>
<p>Most employees are also allowed to change their choice of super fund once every 12 months, so it&rsquo;s never too late to consolidate your super into one easy to manage account.</p>
<h3>Q. What are the benefits of having just one super account?</h3>
<p>If you have more than one super account, you&rsquo;re paying more than one set of fees. Over time, this could be thousands of dollars wasted on fees. Plus, when you have multiple super accounts, it&rsquo;s much harder to keep track of and properly manage your retirement savings.</p>
<p>By having just one super account you&rsquo;ll stop paying unnecessary additional fees and have more money in your account. More money means a higher earnings base and more for you to enjoy when you retire.</p>
<h3>Q. How much could I save by having just one super account?</h3>
<p>What you save will obviously depend on your personal circumstances but let&rsquo;s say you have money invested in four different super funds. For the three funds you no longer contribute to, you&rsquo;re being charged a total of $300 a year in account fees. In five years you&rsquo;ll have paid $1,500 and, after 30 years, a whopping $9,000 in additional fees. And that doesn&rsquo;t even include the interest you will have foregone on this amount.</p>
<p>By consolidating all of your accounts into one, you&rsquo;ll pay one fee and the money you save will provide a higher base for you to enjoy in retirement.</p>
<h3>Q. Are there any things I need to consider before I consolidate?</h3>
<p><strong>Insurance benefits</strong> - Before you consolidate, you should review your insurance arrangements. Most people generally have some form of default insurance cover with their super. If you have three super funds and three lots of default cover, if you become entitled to a payout, you&rsquo;ll generally get a paid from each of your three insurance policies. But when you consolidate your super, your insurance cover in the funds you consolidate will lapse and you&rsquo;ll be left with only one lot of insurance cover.</p>
<p>When you consolidate, you may need to increase your level of cover to ensure you&rsquo;ll have enough if and when you need it. You should also be aware that you may be required to undergo medical tests if you apply for additional cover.</p>
<p><strong>Exit Fees</strong> &ndash; Some funds charge a hefty exit fee if you try to move your money into another fund. If this is the case, you might not benefit from the transfer.</p>
<p><strong>Selecting the right super fund</strong> &ndash; When people do consolidate, they generally roll their super into the fund that they are currently contributing to. While this is the easiest option, you might like to compare all the funds before deciding. Which one has the lowest fees? Which one has the best insurance cover? Which one has the best member benefits? And even though past performance is no guarantee of future performance, which one has the best returns over the medium-longer term?</p>
<h3>Q. What do I need to do to consolidate my super?</h3>
<p>Once your employer is contributing to your chosen super fund the next step is to consolidate any other super you have in other funds. There are generally three steps to consolidate your super.</p>
<ol>
<li>Track down all your different super accounts. If you&rsquo;ve lost contact with your old funds or have no idea where your money is, there are a couple of ways you can find them:</li>
<ul>
<li>Search the ATO&rsquo;s Super Seeker website - <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au/superseeker" target="_blank">www.ato.gov.au/superseeker</a>. All you need is your name, date of birth and tax file number.</li>
<li>Contact your old employers. They&rsquo;ll be able to tell you where they paid your super entitlements.</li>
<li>Search the ASIC Lost Monies Register (<a href="http://www.asic.gov.au/unclaimedmoney" target="_blank">www.asic.gov.au/unclaimedmoney</a>) or the Lost Monies Register in your state.</li>
</ul>
<li>Once you have the details of your accounts you will need to fill in a separate consolidation form for each account.</li>
<li>Send your completed forms to <a href="/{localLink:1278}" title="General Enquiries">us</a> together with certified copies of your identification (your driver&rsquo;s licence or passport is usually the easiest) and we&rsquo;ll do the rest.</li>
</ol>

            <title><![CDATA[Boost your super with a government co-contribution]]></title>
            <summary><![CDATA[If you earn less than $61,920 this financial year and make after-tax contributions to your super, you could be eligible for a co-contribution from the government.]]></summary>
            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>If you earn less than $61,920 this financial year and make after-tax contributions to your super, you could be eligible for a co-contribution from the government.</p>
<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s right. In an effort to help boost the retirement savings of low-middle income Australians the government will match, dollar-for-dollar all voluntary contributions you make to your super fund (of course there are limits and thresholds that apply).</p>
<p>And the best bit is there are no forms to fill in or any messy paperwork &ndash; all you have to do is make your contributions and lodge your tax return. If you qualify, the government will automatically pay your co-contribution into your super account. It really couldn&rsquo;t be simpler.</p>
<h3>Is there a catch?</h3>
<p>No. As long as you meet the eligibility criteria, you&rsquo;re entitled to a co-contribution. The co-contribution is also available to the self-employed. Plus it doesn&rsquo;t matter when you make your contributions during the financial year or how much you contribute &ndash; you can put away $20 a week or make a one-off contribution. Just remember that the co-contribution is calculated on the contributions you make in a financial year, not a calendar year.</p>
<h3>Am I eligible for a co-contribution?</h3>
<p>To qualify for a co-contribution this year you must, for the year ending 30 June 2011:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make at least one voluntary after-tax contribution to your super;</li>
<li>Earn less than $61,920 (this includes your income, your reportable fringe benefits and your reportable employer super contributions);</li>
<li>Earn at least 10% of your total income from employment, running a business or a combination of both;</li>
<li>Be aged less than 71 years at 30 June 2011;</li>
<li>Be a permanent resident of Australia for the entire financial year, and</li>
<li>Lodge a tax return.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How much am I entitled to?</h3>
<p>The amount of the co-contribution you receive will depend on your income and the amount of personal contributions you make. The ATO has a co-contribution calculator you can use or you can use the table below as a guide to see how much of a contribution you&rsquo;re entitled to.</p>
<p>And like your personal contributions, your co-contribution is not taxed when it is paid into your account or when you withdraw it as part of your retirement benefit.</p>

<h3>We can&rsquo;t accept voluntary contributions without your tax file number.</h3>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t provided us with your TFN, we won&rsquo;t be able to accept voluntary contributions on your behalf. This means you could miss out on a co-contribution.</p>
<h3>It&rsquo;s not too late!</h3>
<p>With the end of the financial year fast approaching, there&rsquo;s not much time left to take advantage of a government co-contribution. If you haven&rsquo;t already, make sure you make a voluntary personal contribution to your super account before 30 June 2011. After all we are talking about free money &ndash; what are you waiting for?</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;ve all seen the cheesy ads on TV. One features a group of women drinking coffee showing concern for another friend who is about to lose her home after just losing her husband. Another has a husband and wife team getting the kids ready for soccer while talking about the importance of keeping your family financially secure.</p>
<p>All of these sorts of cringe-worthy ads have two things in common &ndash; they all seem to employ really bad actors and trying to sell life insurance by pulling on the heart strings.</p>
<p>But given Australia has the dubious honour of being one of the most underinsured nations in the developed world (we rank 16th), it clear this tactic just isn&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s time to try something new &ndash; the simple truth.</p>
<p>If you or your partner died or were unable to contribute financially to your household, life insurance is not going to cure all of your problems. It&rsquo;s not going to bring you or your partner back, nor is it going to take away the physical or emotional pain of your loss, injury or illness. Nothing but time can heal those sorts of wounds.</p>
<p>What it can do however is help ease the financial burden of mortgage or rent payments, doctor&rsquo;s bills, childcare costs, school fees and household bills while you get yourself back on your feet. It allows you and your family the opportunity to focus on dealing with the important issues &ndash; spending time with your loved ones or choosing the right treatment options without the added stress and worry that comes with not being able to survive financially.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll never happen to me&rdquo;</h3>
<p>As a nation we have historically been disengaged with the issue of life insurance. While the vast majority of us insure our cars and home and contents, we don&rsquo;t give a second thought to our life or ability to earn an income. Instead we bury our heads in the sand and take comfort in the idea that &lsquo;it&rsquo;ll never happen to me&rsquo; and that even if it does, &lsquo;she&rsquo;ll be right&rsquo;.</p>
<p>A survey conducted by insurer OnePath Life in 2008 found that 89% of Australians believed they were not likely to have an accident that left them unable to work in the next 20 years. 80% believed they were unlikely to suffer a serious illness in the next 20 years.</p>
<p>These beliefs don&rsquo;t really stack up when you consider the actual state of play. According to the Financial Services Council, 50,000 Australians have heart attacks every year and a third of women and a quarter of all men will suffer cancer at some stage in their lifetime. If you were one of these unfortunate people (and chances are you or someone you know will be) could you or your family survive?</p>
<h3>&ldquo;How much life insurance do I need?&rdquo;</h3>
<p>This answer will depend on your individual circumstances, but some basic principles apply.</p>
<p>Working out the right amount of life insurance requires you to think about how much you would need to pay off all debts, how much money you&rsquo;ll need to pay funeral costs, and how much you&rsquo;d like to leave your family to meet their future financial obligations if you were to die.</p>
<p>The commonly accepted rule of thumb (as recommended by Rice Warner Actuaries in its Cost of Underinsurance Project report for IFSA in 2005) is that most people with dependent children generally need ten times their earnings in life insurance. So if you earn $50,000 you&rsquo;d likely need $500,000 in life insurance.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ok, I&rsquo;ve got insurance through my super&rdquo;</h3>
<p>While it is true that most super members have life and temporary and permanent disability (TPD) insurance (commonly through their super fund), many only have a default level of insurance. While this is better than no insurance at all, it is not likely to be able to provide financially in the event of death or disablement.</p>
<p>Rice Warner Actuaries also estimates that life insurance cover within super is on average only 20% of what most individuals and families actually need.</p>
<p>So if you, like many people, were under the assumption that your default level of cover within your super fund was enough, you may need to think again and consider increasing your level of cover. You should also review your level of cover as your circumstances change, for example getting married or divorced, having kids or grandkids or buying a house.</p>
<p>Our insurance benefits are extremely competitive so you may find it doesn't cost as much as you think for an appropriate level of cover.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;Super fund or retail insurer?&rdquo;</h3>
<p>While the most important thing is that you make sure you&rsquo;re covered, there are distinct benefits to taking out insurance through your super fund.</p>
<p>Firstly, and perhaps most importantly for your back pocket, your premiums are deducted directly from your super fund member account. This means it&rsquo;s more tax effective and premiums don&rsquo;t come out of your disposable income.</p>
<p>Because super funds buy cover for all members, they get bulk discount rates from their insurer so you receive the benefit of scale. This means that the premiums you pay for the cover through your super fund are generally cheaper than the rate you could get outside super. It also means that in most cases you can afford a higher more appropriate level of cover through your super fund for the same price of reduced cover through a retail insurer.</p>
<p>Super fund members can also benefit from scale when taking out income protection cover through their super fund. Income protection insurance protects your income when you suffer short term disabilities by providing you with a regular income (usually anywhere between 75-85%) of your monthly income for up to two years. <br /> <br />Importantly, as a member of a super fund, you generally have access to automatic default cover without having to do anything other than join as a member. However if and when you choose to increase your level of cover you may need to provide health information or undergo medicals.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s no secret that farmers in Australia have been doing it tough in recent years. Having endured years of crippling drought to now experiencing devastating floods, bushfires and cyclones no-one could blame our farmers or small business owners for wanting to throw in the towel.</p>
<p>But for those who choose to soldier on, their primary focus in the wake of Mother Nature&rsquo;s wrath is of rebuilding. Of picking up the pieces and moving forward as best one can. But once this initial restoration phase is over it&rsquo;s prudent to think to the future. Could your business or your family survive another disaster &ndash; natural or otherwise? Is your financial future tied up in your business? When the time comes, will you have enough money to retire on?</p>
<p>Planning for the future is important for everyone but more so for those people whose retirement is firmly linked to the success and value of their business.</p>
<p>If you asked a group of self-employed Australians what they were counting on to fund their retirement, the vast majority would say the sale of their business. In an ideal world this would be fine but we know from the weather events of recent years that the business you&rsquo;ve worked your whole life to build could be destroyed in a moment. Further local and/or international economic events could also mean that when you do sell, you might not get the price you&rsquo;d hoped for.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important that when planning for the future, you don&rsquo;t put all of your retirement eggs in the one basket. While you shouldn&rsquo;t discount the value of your business it&rsquo;s a good idea to make sure you have a mixture of both business and non-business assets.</p>
<p><strong>Shares</strong> &ndash; Investing in a share portfolio is a good way to diversify your assets. If times get tough you can sell the shares or you can use the dividends you receive to supplement your income in retirement.</p>
<p><strong>Property</strong> &ndash; If you can afford it, investing in property is another way to boost your non-business assets. If you can afford to buy the property outright or pay it off before you retire, you can use the income received from rent towards your income in retirement. Alternatively there can be some tax advantages to negative gearing so speak to your financial planner to see how investing in property can fit into your financial plan.</p>
<p><strong>Superannuation</strong> - Superannuation is a great tax-effective way to save for retirement. Yet research from the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA) indicates that nearly one third of self employed business owners have no retirement savings and, of those that do, 53% have a super balance of less than $40,000.</p>
<p>Self-employed people are able to claim a tax deduction on the money they contribute to super (up to certain limits). Plus when you retire, you can take your super out as a lump sum or as income stream payments that can be used to supplement your income.</p>
<p>Superannuation is also a good way to invest in a diversified mix of asset classes. Most super funds offer a range of investment options to choose from and allow you to choose where your money is invested. So if you can&rsquo;t afford to go out tomorrow and buy a share portfolio or invest in some property, you can through your super fund for much less money.</p>
<p>Through superannuation, you also have access to life, temporary &amp; permanent disability (TPD) and income protection insurance at discounted group rates. This means you can protect yourself and your family in the event of death or injury.</p>
<p><strong>Business insurance</strong> &ndash; Business insurance is a must for any person running their own business. Business insurance generally covers five main areas &ndash; Loan debt protection, key person insurance, succession planning, business expenses and public liability.</p>
<p>If you own and operate a farm, farm insurance is also available. Generally, most policies will cover things like home and contents, machinery and livestock, liability, personal accident and loss of income and business interruption.</p>
<p>Before taking out an insurance policy it&rsquo;s a good idea to speak to a qualified financial planner to make sure you take out the best policy for your own personal and business needs.</p>
<p>And if the events of the last few months have taught us anything about insurance it&rsquo;s to make sure you understand 100% what is covered by your policy and what is not. Because the last thing you need in a time of crisis is to find out, like many flood victims did, that your insurance policy may not cover you for the event or circumstance that has occurred.</p>]]></mainContent>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m an organ donor. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to be one so when I got my licence at 18, I made sure I ticked the organ donor box and got myself a special &lsquo;I&rsquo;m an organ donor&rsquo; card. But then I found out that despite my wishes, my family can override my decision when the time for donating comes. The only way to make sure that my wishes are carried out was to sit down with my nearest and dearest and have &lsquo;the talk&rsquo;. <br />- Anonymous Organ Donor</p>
<p>Nobody likes talking about death or thinking that someone close to them is ever going to pass away. Often conversations about death that don&rsquo;t revolve around killing bad guys in a computer game are met with &lsquo;you&rsquo;re so morbid&rsquo; or &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going anywhere&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s probably one of the main reasons so many of us don&rsquo;t have wills or life insurance &ndash; not because we don&rsquo;t want to look after our families once we&rsquo;re gone but because we don&rsquo;t like to think about death or dying.</p>
<p>But sadly none of us lives forever and it pays to set aside a couple of hours to sit down with your loved ones to discuss what you want to happen once you are no longer around. This talk, as well as covering finances, assets and personal effects (and organ donation!) should most certainly also include a talk about your super and who you want to receive your benefit once you&rsquo;re gone. Because if you don&rsquo;t, you may find that, like the Anonymous Organ Donor above, what you want, or thought would happen when you die isn&rsquo;t necessarily the case.</p>
<h3>Superannuation, Dependants &amp; Beneficiaries &ndash; some history</h3>
<p>The purpose of superannuation is to provide for our retirement. What is probably lesser known is that superannuation is also meant to provide for our dependents when we die.</p>
<p>This means that when we die, the balance of our superannuation benefit together with any insurance benefit (commonly referred to as a death benefit) can generally only be paid to our dependants, or if there are no dependants, to our estate.</p>
<p>For the purposes of superannuation a dependant can be your spouse (including a de facto or same-sex partner), your children (including a step or adopted child) or any other person who is financially dependent on you.</p>
<p>A beneficiary may not necessarily be a dependant. A beneficiary can be anyone who you would like to receive something either while you&rsquo;re alive or after you&rsquo;re gone.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re drawing up your will, you can generally leave whatever you want to whomever you want. Things work a little differently with super.</p>
<p>Technically whilst you can nominate anyone as the beneficiary of your death benefit, superannuation law restricts who can receive your death benefit. Generally your death benefit must be paid to a dependant, or if you have no dependants, to your estate.</p>
<h3>The benefits to nominating a super beneficiary</h3>
<p>When you nominate your beneficiaries you can ensure that your super fund is aware of your wishes.</p>
<p>In modern Australia family no longer just means mum, dad and kids. There are now husbands and wives, ex-husbands and ex-wives, de facto partners and ex-de facto partners. Then there are kids, step kids, adopted kids and step relatives. Our families have become so blended that sometimes even we&rsquo;re not sure who we&rsquo;re related to!<br /> <br />If you don&rsquo;t nominate a beneficiary/ies to receive your death benefit, the trustee of your super fund will decide who receives your benefit. While they will no doubt do their best to make sure your dependants are looked after, their decision may not necessarily be in line with your wishes. Plus given the ever-changing family dynamic, your fund may not be able to locate all of your dependants.</p>
<h3>Two types of beneficiaries - preferred and binding</h3>
<p>When it comes to super there are two different types of beneficiary nominations you can make &ndash; preferred or binding.</p>
<p>A <strong>preferred beneficiary</strong> is someone that you would prefer to receive your death benefit. Upon your death the Trustee of your super fund will take your preference into account when paying out your death benefit but will ultimately decide who gets it according to the law.</p>
<p>Alternatively a <strong>binding beneficiary</strong> is legally binding (but it must be renewed every three years) and sets out the people that you want to receive your death benefit. It gives you more certainty and means that when you die, your benefit will be paid to the people you want to receive it. However for this to happen there are a couple of requirements that you must satisfy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your nomination must be valid. This means that it cannot be older than three years old, must be filled in correctly and must have been witnessed by two people who are not listed as beneficiaries, and</li>
<li>The people you have nominated qualify as super beneficiaries at the time the benefit is paid. This means you must nominate people who are your dependants, who are financially dependent on you, or your personal legal representative.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t meet these requirements, the Trustee of your super fund may not be able to pay out your death benefit according to your wishes.</p>
<p>Not all super funds offer binding beneficiaries but we do. Fill in a binding nomination of beneficiaries form or <a href="/{localLink:1278}" title="General Enquiries">contact us</a> for more detais.</p>
<h3>It&rsquo;s important to review your beneficiaries when your circumstances change</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s important that you review your beneficiaries when your personal circumstances change. Significant events like marriage, divorce, having kids or grandkids, death of a family member or making or changing your will should serve as a prompt that your super beneficiaries also need to be updated. Just imagine the kerfuffle it would cause when you passed away if you forget to include your youngest child or your new partner as one of your beneficiaries!</p>]]></mainContent>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<div class="moduleCtaList">
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: Prime Super member's should have received their half yearly account summaries in the mail recently. If you have not received yours please contact us on 1800 675 839. Alternatively if you are registered for online services you can log in to your secure member account and check your summary online.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>You should have received an important piece of mail recently. No &ndash; not the latest fast food menu &ndash; your half yearly member account summary.</p>
<p>Sadly not many people appreciate just how important correspondance from their super funds are. Once opened (that&rsquo;s if they&rsquo;re opened) are almost never read and many end up in the recycling bin.</p>
<p>Your super is your money and is likely to be one of the main influences in the kind of lifestyle you lead in retirement. It&rsquo;s important that when you get your account summary you check it and make sure you understand what it says. Because investing a little time, money and effort into your super now can pay dividends when you retire.</p>
<h3>6 questions you should ask yourself when your account summary arrives</h3>
<p><strong>1. Did you receive more than one account summary?</strong></p>
<p>If you received more than one super account summary it means you have more than one super account and could be paying unnecessary fees. If you do have more than one super account it&rsquo;s worth consolidating them into one. This way you&rsquo;ll stop paying multiple fees and your super will have a higher base from which to grow.</p>
<p><strong>2. What&rsquo;s your account balance? Have your SG contributions been paid by your employer?</strong></p>
<p>Check your account balance and transaction listing. Your account balance will show you how much you&rsquo;ve got in super while your transaction listing will show you all the super your employer has contributed (including any salary sacrifice and voluntary contributions you may have made) during the last financial year.</p>
<p>If your employer hasn&rsquo;t paid your super entitlements or you think the amount is incorrect make sure you speak to them as soon as possible to get it sorted.</p>
<p>Step one is to speak to your employer to clarify how much super you&rsquo;re entitled to and when it should have been paid into your super account. If you get an unsatisfactory answer from your employer you should lodge an enquiry about unpaid super with the Tax Office.</p>
<p><strong>3. How much insurance cover do you have?</strong></p>
<p>Insurance cover &ndash; death, TPD and income protection are an important element of your super, yet some people are unaware of their level of cover or that they even have insurance at all. When you get your statement you should review your level of cover.</p>
<p>You may find that if it&rsquo;s been awhile since you&rsquo;ve checked you may need to increase your level of cover.</p>
<p><strong>4. Where is your money invested?</strong></p>
<p>The majority of Australians have their super invested in their super fund&rsquo;s balanced investment option. While this may be fine for most, it&rsquo;s worth reviewing your investment options to see if there&rsquo;s another option better suited to your investment horizon and risk profile.</p>
<p><strong>5. Have you nominated a beneficiary?</strong></p>
<p>If you have it will be listed on your account summary. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for people to nominate a beneficiary when they first open their super account and then forget about it. If your personal circumstances have changed since you first nominated a beneficiary (you might have gotten married, divorced or had children) it&rsquo;s a good idea to check and update your nomination so that the people you want to receive your benefit when you die are not left out in the cold.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t nominated a beneficiary at all, it&rsquo;s a good idea to have a think about who you would like to receive your benefit once you pass away. It&rsquo;s also important to remember that the purpose of your super is to provide for you in retirement and for your dependants when you pass away.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of nominations you can make &ndash; preferred and binding. A preferred beneficiary is someone that you would prefer to receive your death benefit should you die. It is not binding or legally enforceable and although your super fund will take your preference into account when paying your death benefit, the fund will ultimately decide who should receive your death benefit according to the law.</p>
<p>In this circumstance your death benefit is usually made to one or more of your dependants or to your legal personal representative.</p>
<p>A binding death benefit nomination provides more certainty over who will receive your death benefit. It is legally binding and must be renewed every three years. And as long as it is valid at the time of your death, your benefit will be paid out according to your nomination provided that the people you have nominated qualify as beneficiaries at the time the benefit is paid.</p>
<p><strong>6. How much are you paying in fees?</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to check how much you&rsquo;re paying in fees to ensure that your super isn&rsquo;t being eroded by fees. We&rsquo;ve all seen the industry super fund television commercials that show the difference that fees can make to your final super balance. So if you think you&rsquo;re paying too much in fees it&rsquo;s worth shopping around for some less expensive options.</p>]]></mainContent>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Sam started a new job last week. He arrived on his first day and was given a stack of papers by his new employer. He takes them home and fills in the important ones - the bank details form and the tax file number declaration. There&rsquo;s one in there about superannuation but he doesn&rsquo;t really pay any attention to it &ndash; he doesn&rsquo;t want to rock the boat and is happy to have his super paid to his employer&rsquo;s default super fund.</p>
<p>If this was Sam&rsquo;s first job he&rsquo;d have nothing to worry about. But it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s his fourth and assuming he did exactly the same thing for his previous jobs, it&rsquo;s likely he now has four different super fund accounts.</p>
<p>If this scenario sounds familiar to you you&rsquo;re not alone. The majority of working Australians have more than one super account. In fact a CHOICE study on super found that in 2008 there were almost 32 million super accounts and only 10.7 million workers. When you do the maths it works out to around 3 super accounts per person.<br /><br />What most people forget (or don&rsquo;t know) is that: a) it&rsquo;s better in the long run to have just one super account, and b) that just because you change jobs doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to change super funds.</p>
<h3>Starting a new job &ndash; your rights and entitlements</h3>
<p>Most Australian workers are entitled to choose where they would like their super contributions to be paid. When you start your new job, if you do want your super to be paid into a particular fund, all you have to do is give your employer the details of your chosen super fund together with a copy of your fund&rsquo;s letter of compliance.</p>
<p>Most employees are also allowed to change their choice of super fund once every 12 months, so it&rsquo;s never too late to consolidate your super into one easy to manage account.</p>
<h3>Q. What are the benefits of having just one super account?</h3>
<p>If you have more than one super account, you&rsquo;re paying more than one set of fees. Over time, this could be thousands of dollars wasted on fees. Plus, when you have multiple super accounts, it&rsquo;s much harder to keep track of and properly manage your retirement savings.</p>
<p>By having just one super account you&rsquo;ll stop paying unnecessary additional fees and have more money in your account. More money means a higher earnings base and more for you to enjoy when you retire.</p>
<h3>Q. How much could I save by having just one super account?</h3>
<p>What you save will obviously depend on your personal circumstances but let&rsquo;s say you have money invested in four different super funds. For the three funds you no longer contribute to, you&rsquo;re being charged a total of $300 a year in account fees. In five years you&rsquo;ll have paid $1,500 and, after 30 years, a whopping $9,000 in additional fees. And that doesn&rsquo;t even include the interest you will have foregone on this amount.</p>
<p>By consolidating all of your accounts into one, you&rsquo;ll pay one fee and the money you save will provide a higher base for you to enjoy in retirement.</p>
<h3>Q. Are there any things I need to consider before I consolidate?</h3>
<p><span>Insurance benefits</span>&nbsp;- Before you consolidate, you should review your insurance arrangements. Most people generally have some form of default insurance cover with their super. If you have three super funds and three lots of default cover, if you become entitled to a payout, you&rsquo;ll generally get a paid from each of your three insurance policies. But when you consolidate your super, your insurance cover in the funds you consolidate will lapse and you&rsquo;ll be left with only one lot of insurance cover.</p>
<p>When you consolidate, you may need to increase your level of cover to ensure you&rsquo;ll have enough if and when you need it. You should also be aware that you may be required to undergo medical tests if you apply for additional cover.</p>
<p><span>Exit Fees</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Some funds charge a hefty exit fee if you try to move your money into another fund. If this is the case, you might not benefit from the transfer.</p>
<p><span>Selecting the right super fund</span>&nbsp;&ndash; When people do consolidate, they generally roll their super into the fund that they are currently contributing to. While this is the easiest option, you might like to compare all the funds before deciding. Which one has the lowest fees? Which one has the best insurance cover? Which one has the best member benefits? And even though past performance is no guarantee of future performance, which one has the best returns over the medium-longer term?</p>
<h3>Q. What do I need to do to consolidate my super?</h3>
<p>Once your employer is contributing to your chosen super fund the next step is to consolidate any other super you have in other funds. There are generally three steps to consolidate your super.</p>
<ol>
<li>Track down all your different super accounts. If you&rsquo;ve lost contact with your old funds or have no idea where your money is, there are a couple of ways you can find them:</li>
<ul>
<li>Search the ATO&rsquo;s Super Seeker website -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ato.gov.au/superseeker" target="_blank">www.ato.gov.au/superseeker</a>. All you need is your name, date of birth and tax file number.</li>
<li>Contact your old employers. They&rsquo;ll be able to tell you where they paid your super entitlements.</li>
<li>Search the ASIC Lost Monies Register (<a href="http://www.asic.gov.au/unclaimedmoney" target="_blank">www.asic.gov.au/unclaimedmoney</a>) or the Lost Monies Register in your state.</li>
</ul>
<li>Once you have the details of your accounts you will need to fill in a separate consolidation form for each account.</li>
<li>Send your completed forms to&nbsp;<a href="/{localLink:1278}" title="General Enquiries">us</a>&nbsp;together with certified copies of your identification (your driver&rsquo;s licence or passport is usually the easiest) and we&rsquo;ll do the rest.</li>
</ol>

            <title><![CDATA[Important information for employers affected by natural disasters]]></title>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<h3>Advice from the ATO regarding super guarantee obligations.</h3>
<p>The ATO understands that people and businesses affected by natural disasters may have difficulty in meeting their super guarantee obligations.</p>
<p>If you cannot make your contributions for a quarter, you must lodge a Superannuation guarantee charge statement - quarterly (NAT 9599). Please check Superannuation reporting and lodgment dates for the most up-to-date information. The ATO recommends that a statement be lodged as soon as possible, as nominal interest (currently 10%) will accrue on shortfall contributions. It only stops accruing once the Superannuation guarantee statement - quarterly is lodged. As the interest is paid to the employee to compensate for lost earnings, the ATO has no discretion in waiving it (as is the case with income tax).</p>
<p>The ATO will not impose other usual penalties, and will consider remitting any general interest charge at the time the super guarantee debt is paid.</p>
<p><strong>I'm an employer and I've already been advised that I'm being audited for super guarantee. I've lost my records. What do I do? Are you going to continue to audit me?</strong></p>
<p>At this stage, the ATO will suspend the audit of your records. Contact will be made at a later date to advise what action will be taken by the ATO. The ATO recognises that many people have lost records, and will work sympathetically with you to review your situation.</p>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;m an employer and I want to wind up my business because of natural disaster. What do I do if I have outstanding super obligations?</strong></p>
<p>You will need to pay your outstanding super obligations for your employees before you wind up your business. The ATO recommends that a Superannuation guarantee charge statement - quarterly be lodged as soon as possible, as nominal interest (currently 10%) continues to accrue until the statement is lodged. As the nominal interest component makes up for the interest that is lost to employees, the ATO has no discretion in waiving this interest.</p>
<p>The ATO will not impose other usual penalties, and could consider the remission of the general interest charge at the time the super guarantee debt is paid.</p>
<p><strong>I am an employer and all my employee records have been destroyed. How can I calculate the super guarantee contributions for my employees?</strong></p>
<p>The ATO recommends that an estimate of super guarantee contributions be made using old records. These could possibly be obtained from your employees, your bank or the super funds you pay contributions to. The ATO can help you with old records of PAYG payments you've made. It would be sensible to discuss how you are going to make this estimate with your employees, both because they might be able to help with records and because they should understand how you're calculating their super payments.</p>
<p><strong>I am an employer and I consistently meet my superannuation obligations. I tried to get my super guarantee contributions in by the due date. However, I have been affected by natural disaster and was late with my contributions. Is there anything you can do to help me?</strong></p>
<p>In exceptional circumstances only, the Commissioner may decide not to raise a super guarantee charge assessment. The employer must have taken reasonable steps to comply with their obligations by the due date, but for reasons beyond their control the contribution is made late. This will be determined on a case by case basis.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>You&rsquo;d think, what with drought, floods and government plans to send communities broke, that not much good happens in the country.</p>
<p>Well, you should have been in Ballarat on Saturday night.</p>
<p>It was there the annual Regional Achievement and Community Awards were announced and presented.</p>
<p>These are the "Australian of the Year" awards for country Victoria, with everyone from individuals to community groups and businesses honoured.</p>
<p>Story after story rolled out of amazing achievements and selfless acts.</p>
<p>Of people such as Michael Stott, of Kinglake West, a year 12 student who has single handedly revived tennis in the fire-devastated district.</p>
<p>Or Mirboo North's Mark Uren, who gave up his job to co-ordinate the bushfire recovery in Gippsland after Black Saturday.</p>
<p>And Regional Achiever Award winner Doris Paton, of Morwell, who is doing everything she possibly can to improve opportunities for indigenous people through education.</p>
<p>Then there were the groups.</p>
<p>The Kyabram Ambulance Auxiliary which, after years of fundraising and arm twisting, finally saw the towns's new ambulance station opened this year.</p>
<p>The Awakenings Festival in Horsham, Australia's only regional disability arts festival. In 14 years it has grown to a five-day annual festival with 840 performers in 50 events attracting 10,500 visitors.</p>
<p>But the great story of the night was the Community Group of the Year, Wycheproof Vision.</p>
<p>Wycheproof is home to 700 people, 280km northwest of Melbourne, smack bang in the middle of grain country.</p>
<p>It is home to the world's smallest mountain, Mt Wycheproof, which towers a staggering 43m above the surrounding plains.</p>
<p>Until recently it had also been home to a dwindling population and not much else.</p>
<p>That's when Wycheproof Vision, an all-encompassing community group, stepped in.</p>
<p>In the past few years it has launched the Rent-a-Farmhouse and Rent-a-Shop for a Dollar programs, which have seen about 30 new households attracted to the town.</p>
<p>And they have started the Great Grain Festival, reviving the King of the Mountain race.</p>
<p>Then came the Music on the Mount festival and the Mt Wycheproof Cup (which is on this Saturday).</p>
<p>This is a little town with a big heart.</p>
<p>The elation when they won the award was palpable. Those there from Wycheproof could barely contain their excitement.</p>
<p>But that was just a taste of things to come.</p>
<p>Getting home to Wycheproof at 2am, they hit the phones at 6am on Sunday to muster a crowd for a group photograph.</p>
<p>By 2pm nearly 200 residents had gathered for the picture that appears on the front of The Weekly Times today.</p>
<p>That's 200 people out of a population of 700 on a few hours' notice.</p>
<p>Proportionately, if you took that picture in Melbourne, more than a million people would have to turn up.</p>
<p>That single act, where a sizeable chunk of the town will move heaven and earth to mark the win, where they all feel part of the community, is what makes regional communities so special.</p>
<p>Ed Gannon is editor of The Weekly Times and a judge of the Regional Achievement and Community Awards.</p>
<p>Prime Super was the proud sponsor of the Prime Super Community Group of the Year Award in Victoria.</p>]]></mainContent>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>A bus travelling from Ballarat to Wycheproof was rocking on Saturday night as Wycheproof Vision community group returned home.</p>
<p>The members were surprised and elated after winning the Prime Super Community Group of the Year Award at the Regional Achievement and Community Awards.</p>
<p>The award recognised the group's efforts to promote the Mallee town and help sustain its future amid drought.</p>
<p>President Ann Dune said the award would spur the group on to achieve more for the community.</p>
<p>"We are so excited, we cannot believe that we have actually won, because we are such a small town that we just can't believe we've done this well," Ms Dune said.</p>
<p>Committee member Kylie Brown said the award would help energise the town.</p>
<p>"It will give us renewed energy which is always important, it just acknowledges all the hard work that's been going on for the past few years, particularly with the drought in our community," Ms Brown said.</p>
<p>The 9th annual Regional Achievement and Community awards celebrated regional Victoria's community and industry leaders across eight categories.</p>
<p>Winners included family-owned businesses, a student newspaper and inspirational community members.</p>
<p>The Parks Victoria Regional Achiever Award was won by Dr Doris Paton of Morwell for her work as a teacher, particularly within the Aboriginal community.</p>
<p>Ms Paton said she was humbled by the award.</p>
<p>"My parents have brought us up thinking it's not what you do but how we give back, and how we have a responsibility to give back, as educators, to our community." she said.</p>
<p>Prime Super was the proud sponsor of the Prime Super Community Group of the Year Award in Victoria.</p>]]></mainContent>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<div class="moduleCtaList">
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE: Prime Super member's should have received their half yearly account summaries in the mail recently. If you have not received yours please contact us on 1800 675 839. Alternatively if you are registered for online services you can log in to your secure member account and check your summary online.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>You should have received an important piece of mail recently. No &ndash; not the latest fast food menu &ndash; your half yearly member account summary.</p>
<p>Sadly not many people appreciate just how important correspondance from their super funds are. Once opened (that&rsquo;s if they&rsquo;re opened) are almost never read and many end up in the recycling bin.</p>
<p>Your super is your money and is likely to be one of the main influences in the kind of lifestyle you lead in retirement. It&rsquo;s important that when you get your account summary you check it and make sure you understand what it says. Because investing a little time, money and effort into your super now can pay dividends when you retire.</p>
<h3>6 questions you should ask yourself when your account summary arrives</h3>
<p><strong>1. Did you receive more than one account summary?</strong></p>
<p>If you received more than one super account summary it means you have more than one super account and could be paying unnecessary fees. If you do have more than one super account it&rsquo;s worth consolidating them into one. This way you&rsquo;ll stop paying multiple fees and your super will have a higher base from which to grow.</p>
<p><strong>2. What&rsquo;s your account balance? Have your SG contributions been paid by your employer?</strong></p>
<p>Check your account balance and transaction listing. Your account balance will show you how much you&rsquo;ve got in super while your transaction listing will show you all the super your employer has contributed (including any salary sacrifice and voluntary contributions you may have made) during the last financial year.</p>
<p>If your employer hasn&rsquo;t paid your super entitlements or you think the amount is incorrect make sure you speak to them as soon as possible to get it sorted.</p>
<p>Step one is to speak to your employer to clarify how much super you&rsquo;re entitled to and when it should have been paid into your super account. If you get an unsatisfactory answer from your employer you should lodge an enquiry about unpaid super with the Tax Office.</p>
<p><strong>3. How much insurance cover do you have?</strong></p>
<p>Insurance cover &ndash; death, TPD and income protection are an important element of your super, yet some people are unaware of their level of cover or that they even have insurance at all. When you get your statement you should review your level of cover.</p>
<p>You may find that if it&rsquo;s been awhile since you&rsquo;ve checked you may need to increase your level of cover.</p>
<p><strong>4. Where is your money invested?</strong></p>
<p>The majority of Australians have their super invested in their super fund&rsquo;s balanced investment option. While this may be fine for most, it&rsquo;s worth reviewing your investment options to see if there&rsquo;s another option better suited to your investment horizon and risk profile.</p>
<p><strong>5. Have you nominated a beneficiary?</strong></p>
<p>If you have it will be listed on your account summary. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for people to nominate a beneficiary when they first open their super account and then forget about it. If your personal circumstances have changed since you first nominated a beneficiary (you might have gotten married, divorced or had children) it&rsquo;s a good idea to check and update your nomination so that the people you want to receive your benefit when you die are not left out in the cold.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t nominated a beneficiary at all, it&rsquo;s a good idea to have a think about who you would like to receive your benefit once you pass away. It&rsquo;s also important to remember that the purpose of your super is to provide for you in retirement and for your dependants when you pass away.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of nominations you can make &ndash; preferred and binding. A preferred beneficiary is someone that you would prefer to receive your death benefit should you die. It is not binding or legally enforceable and although your super fund will take your preference into account when paying your death benefit, the fund will ultimately decide who should receive your death benefit according to the law.</p>
<p>In this circumstance your death benefit is usually made to one or more of your dependants or to your legal personal representative.</p>
<p>A binding death benefit nomination provides more certainty over who will receive your death benefit. It is legally binding and must be renewed every three years. And as long as it is valid at the time of your death, your benefit will be paid out according to your nomination provided that the people you have nominated qualify as beneficiaries at the time the benefit is paid.</p>
<p><strong>6. How much are you paying in fees?</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to check how much you&rsquo;re paying in fees to ensure that your super isn&rsquo;t being eroded by fees. We&rsquo;ve all seen the industry super fund television commercials that show the difference that fees can make to your final super balance. So if you think you&rsquo;re paying too much in fees it&rsquo;s worth shopping around for some less expensive options.</p>]]></mainContent>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Friday 10 September was World Suicide Prevention Day.</p>
<p>Anyone who has been affected by suicide knows how heartbreaking it is. It not only means a tragic loss of life but also great sadness, soul-searching and unanswered questions for those left behind. Did we miss the signs? Was there something we could have done? Why?</p>
<p>Each year World Suicide Prevention Day provides an opportunity for communities and families all over the world to raise awareness of this growing problem and talk about how they can help address the growing and sometimes preventable problem of suicide.</p>
<p>The statistics are depressing - the World Health Organization estimates that about one million people die by suicide every year. This represents one death every 40 seconds. And for every person that commits suicide there are a further 20 or more who attempt to take their own lives.</p>
<p>Closer to home, the picture is not any better. On average six people die each day from suicide in Australia &ndash; that&rsquo;s more than 2000 people each year. And for the six people that do take their lives, a further 178 people attempt suicide. Suicide is also the leading cause of death of Australians under the age of 44.</p>
<p>The story is even grimmer in rural Australia. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, suicide rates in rural areas are 33% higher than major cities and an alarming 189% higher in very remote areas.</p>
<p>This is further compounded for younger Australians (aged 15-24 years) and older Australians (aged 55 years and over), particularly males in rural areas, who Suicide Prevention Australia have found to be 30-50% more likely to end their lives than their urban counterparts. In fact a 2008 World Health Organisation study found that the rate of rural suicide in Australia is among the highest in the developed world.</p>
<p>With the state of play so dire in our rural communities, it&rsquo;s time to overcome any real or imagined awkwardness we have around suicide and get suicide prevention more prominence on the global, national and local agenda.</p>
<h3>Why is suicide more prevalent in rural communities and what can we do to address the problem?</h3>
<p>Rural Australians face unique problems. Despite being the lifeblood of this country, they are often at Mother Nature&rsquo;s whim facing the very real realities of bushfire, drought, and flood. Plus there are the stock and crop losses and the unstable financial situation that often results from these natural disasters.</p>
<p>However while women are generally good at talking about how they feel and seeking help when they need it, rural men (and men in general) aren&rsquo;t. So instead of seeking help when they are struggling, they retreat into themselves and sink further into the spiral of depression and/or mental illness. This in turn can lead to suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>According to the National Rural Health Alliance there are different risk factors at play for younger males. Unemployment, loneliness, sexual orientation, adverse life events, undiagnosed or untreated mental illness and alcohol and drug abuse can increase a young person&rsquo;s risk of self harm.</p>
<h3>What can we do?</h3>
<p>As a community we need to make sure that we all do our bit to increase awareness of suicide prevention. We can do this by talking about it and making sure we all understand and can recognise the warning signs of depression and mental illness.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what World Suicide Prevention Day is all about. It&rsquo;s about raising awareness and developing and implementing local, national and global strategies and interventions to lower the rate of suicide. World Suicide Prevention Day started the dialogue. It&rsquo;s up to all of us to make sure the conversation continues. Because one life lost to suicide is one too many.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Seasonal workers &ndash; home grown and those that are just visiting &ndash; have a positive effect on our economy and help ensure that regional employers &ndash; especially growers - have access to workers when they need them. But the nature of the work (and the travelling backpacker) also means that they rarely stay in one place for too long. This constant staff turnover can often leave some smaller employers bogged down in paperwork as they administer workers&rsquo; checks, payroll, superannuation and all the other obligations that are part and parcel of hiring an employee.</p>
<p>To avoid this situation, more and more growers are turning to contractors and labour hire firms to procure workers. These firms charge employers a premium for providing access to labour and in return take responsibility for the payment and administration of all the associated employment costs.</p>
<p>Sounds like a fair trade except that sometimes hiring a contractor does not free you from your responsibilities and not all labour hire firms operate in a legal or compliant manner. And when the chips are down and the authorities come a calling, it is often the grower who is left to pick up the pieces and often the costs.</p>
<p>If you are considering using contractors or a labour hire firm to procure seasonal workers, here are some of the things you need to be aware of.</p>
<h2>Contractors</h2>
<p>Many employers think that if they hire an independent contractor to carry out some work, they don&rsquo;t have to worry about the various laws that apply to employment &ndash; you simply pay the bill at the end of the job and you both go your separate way.</p>
<p>In some cases this is true but this is not always the case. Even though a person might say they are a contractor, the law may still class them as your employee and all of your obligations to them (superannuation, tax, workers compensation, annual leave etc) will still apply.</p>
<p>Although there are a number of factors which can help you determine the difference between an employee and an independent contractor, there is unfortunately no single indicator that can determine if a person is one or the other. In the event of a dispute, courts will always look at the totality of the relationship between the two parties before making a decision.</p>
<p>Fair Work Australia (<a href="http://www.fwa.gov.au/" target="_blank">www.fwa.gov.au</a>) and the National Farmers Federation (<a href="http://www.nff.org.au/" target="_blank">www.nff.org.au</a>) have both put out guidelines to help you make a determination but if you&rsquo;re having trouble, it&rsquo;s best to give Fair Work Australia or your Employer Association a call.</p>
<h2>Labour hire firms</h2>
<p>Labour hire firms are a great way for employers, especially growers, to access labour when they need it most and often without much notice. They also allow the grower to focus on the job at hand because the labour firm is responsible for the payment and administration of all employment costs.</p>
<p>While the vast majority of these firms provide an excellent service to the community, there are unfortunately a small number that are less than professional. These questionable firms may underpay their workers, may use illegal workers and may not pay workers any of their entitlements, including superannuation.</p>
<p>If things go wrong and Fair Work Australia comes to investigate, growers themselves may be left to foot the bill towards employees&rsquo; entitlements.</p>
<h2>There are ways you can protext yourself</h2>
<p><strong>Insist the labour hire firm sign a contract</strong> &ndash; although there is no legal obligation for employers and labour firms to enter into a formal contract, if you&rsquo;re using a labour firm for the first time, it&rsquo;s a good idea to insist they sign one.</p>
<p>The contract will spell out each party&rsquo;s obligations and can protect the employers if the firm doesn&rsquo;t pay their workers correctly.</p>
<p>If the firm you&rsquo;re dealing with refuses to sign a contract it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean they are operating outside the law but it should raise some red flags. At the very least you should ask them why they don&rsquo;t want to enter into a formal agreement and be satisfied with their answer. If you&rsquo;re not, walk away.</p>
<p>Similarly if, you&rsquo;re unhappy with the contract that&rsquo;s been provided to you by a labour hire firm, it&rsquo;s important that you do not commence work with the firm. Often a commencement of work will be interpreted as an acceptance of a contract, even though there is nothing in writing.</p>
<p><strong>If the firm offers to provide you with labour at a price that&rsquo;s too good to be true, it probably is</strong> &ndash; Let&rsquo;s say minimum wage is $20 an hour. If a labour firm offers you workers for $10 an hour it&rsquo;s a pretty good indication that something is not quite right.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s no way your $10 an hour is going to cover all of the legitimate employment costs for the workers the firm provides. And you can be guaranteed that the firm is not going to cover the extra costs from their own pockets. Instead it&rsquo;s likely that the firm does not pay their workers correctly or may not pay workers their superannuation or leave entitlements for the work they do.</p>
<p>You may also be liable for hefty fines from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship if they visit your farm and find illegal workers.</p>
<p><strong>Make sure the superannuation entitlements are paid on behalf of the labour hire firm and yourself</strong> &ndash; To avoid any possible penalties down the track, you should insist that the labour hire firm notify the relevant superannuation fund that the contributions being made are on your behalf as well as the labour hire firm. This doesn&rsquo;t cost the firm any money and it will protect you from any unnecessary worry.</p>]]></mainContent>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>We all know how the saying goes but unfortunately when it comes to finances, some women are definitely not leading the &lsquo;greater&rsquo; charge. As a group it seems there are just too many other things to worry about. But with women living longer, and divorce just as likely as the probability of staying married, financial independence should be a reality, not a pipe dream, for all Australian women.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Financial Literacy - Women understanding money&rsquo; report by the Australian Government&rsquo;s Financial Literacy Foundation, found that 52% of women find dealing with money stressful and overwhelming and an 23% don&rsquo;t think they have the ability to plan for their long term future. While these figures are far from positive, in fairness history dictates that financial independence is relatively new and unknown territory for women. Considering as recently as the 1960s, where women working in some parts of the public sector were required to leave their jobs once they married, it&rsquo;s not surprising that very few of our mothers and grandmothers have been in a position to impart individual financial pearls of wisdom.</p>
<p>While the Australian picture of social equality is constantly improving, the fact remains that the majority of women face unique and specific issues when it comes to their finances. Traditionally women are far more likely to take time out of the work force to have children or to act as care givers to family members. Whether this means dropping back to part time work or exiting the work force altogether, it all equals one thing &ndash; less income, less entitlements and less super. Combine that with a longer life expectancy and you have some real issues all women should be thinking about.</p>
<p>So what can be done?</p>
<h3>Plan ahead and save</h3>
<ul>
<li>In anticipation of taking extended breaks from the workforce, start saving during the periods where you are employed full time. Monitor your spending, set a budget and stick to it. No one enjoys being more frugal but knowing your spending habits can assist you greatly in making positive changes and avoiding unnecessary expenses. Be flexible and allow your budget to adapt as your needs change.</li>
<li>Set up a dedicated savings account for the long term and harness the power of compounding interest. Compound interest is a powerful tool that makes money contributed today, far more valuable than anything you save later in life.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Contributions</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you work casually or part time, you can offset some of the financial disadvantages of your situation by making voluntary contributions to your superannuation. By doing so you might also qualify for a Government co-contribution. If you do qualify, the Government will match, dollar for dollar all after-tax contributions you make to your super up to a maximum of $1000. This amount will be reduced by 3.33 cents for every dollar your total income is over $31,920 up to $61,920. Over the course of the year a $1000 contribution amounts to less than the value of some magazines and a few drinks each week. Combine this with the Government match and you could see a big difference to your final balance come retirement time. To find out if you qualify for a co-contribution please refer to the ATO website <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au/" target="_blank">www.ato.gov.au</a>.</li>
<li>Even if you are not working or earn an income for a period of time, you may still be able to increase your retirement savings via spouse contributions. If your partner is working he or she can make contributions into your super account on your behalf. This can be a tax-effective strategy as every contribution made, up to a total of $3000 per year, could be eligible for a tax rebate of up to $540.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Education</h3>
<ul>
<li>For everything in life, education is the key to independence. Take some time to learn about financial matters. Take a course, read some books or speak to the experts at financial seminars. Every extra piece of information gained will improve your financial literacy and equip you with the skills to take charge of your financial future.<br />Also consider the benefits of finding a financial planner that you trust. No matter where you are starting from, a financial planner will help you think about where you want to be, help you set achievable goals and start you moving towards them.</li>
<li>Remember, it&rsquo;s never too late to improve your financial literacy and, in turn, your financial situation. Think about your future, your goals, where you&rsquo;d like to be in 5, 10 and 30 years time and take the first step towards an independent and positive financial future today.</li>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>We spend over half of our lifetime slogging it out in the workforce, so it's no surprise that most of us dream of retirement and the chance to kick back, relax and enjoy some much earned 'me time'.</p>
<p>Yet as the prospect of retiring draws closer the thought of what to do with all that free time can start to feel a little daunting.</p>
<p>Aside from the obvious financial changes, the move into retirement represents a fairly drastic change of lifestyle. You need to consider not only how your finances will be managed, but also how you will handle not having to go to work each day and what you&rsquo;re going to do with your free time, now that you have so much more of it.</p>
<h3>It&rsquo;s not always smooth sailing</h3>
<p>One of the biggest selling points of retirement is that it gives you the chance to enjoy many of the things you may not have had time for up to now. For some people this transition will be smooth and welcome spent doing things they&rsquo;ve always dreamed of. But for others, whose sense of purpose and source of social interaction is intimately linked to their job, the change can be unsettling and less than ideal.</p>
<h3>It&rsquo;s important to have a plan</h3>
<p>As with most things in life, it pays to have a plan. You might not stick to it, but putting some thought into how you will spend your time can help reduce the risk of boredom or loneliness. For some people retirement can provide an opportunity to undertake further study, take up a new sport or hobby, volunteer for a not-for-profit organisation, train for a marathon, mentor a young person or travel somewhere new. Whatever takes your fancy, having a new area of focus after retirement makes the transition easier in many ways. Doing something of value provides purpose and the new networks you build can replace the social interactions you enjoyed during your working life.</p>
<h3>Easing into the transition</h3>
<p>When it comes to making the actual transition there are a number of different approaches. Some people retire at the earliest possible age, finishing work one day and entering retirement the next.</p>
<p>Others prefer to make the move gradually, perhaps moving to part-time employment for a few years before stopping work altogether. This can be a great option as not only does it mean you will continue to receive a wage, it also means that you can continue to benefit from the social aspects of a job. In addition, you&rsquo;ll have some free time to start pursuing the activities that will take on more prominence once you reach full retirement.</p>
<h3>Your super can help</h3>
<p>While the idea of working less is definitely appealing, part-time work usually also means a part-time wage - not exactly ideal when you still have bills to pay.</p>
<h3>This is where your super can help.</h3>
<p>With a superannuation transition to retirement strategy, you can access your super while you&rsquo;re still working as long as you've reached your preservation age.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>You can take advantage of the transition to retirement option by rolling the money in your super account into an income stream. Once you've done that, you can start receiving regular payments from your super.</p>
<p>This means that you can reduce the hours you work without sacrificing your lifestyle since your salary is supplemented by regular payments from your income stream.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can continue to work full-time and use the additional income to enjoy life's luxuries. Or you could reap the tax benefits of salary sacrificing more of your wage into super (effectively paying the 15% contributions tax rather than your tax-rate) and continue to build your retirement nest egg.</p>
<p>Not all superannuation funds offer income stream products. If yours doesn&rsquo;t and you like the sounds of &lsquo;transitioning to retirement&rsquo; it&rsquo;s worth shopping around for a fund that does.</p>
<h3>Feeling confused? Help is out there</h3>
<p>Opting to take a slower route to retirement can help you gradually adjust to one of your biggest lifestyle changes. However, it goes without saying that if you are faced with such decisions it pays to seek the advice of a trusted independent financial advisor. A financial advisor can put in place a financial plan that takes into account your needs and wishes, while taking into consideration all the government rules and regulations that may work to your advantage.</p>
<p>When you are discussing your financial plan it&rsquo;s also a good idea to consider your lifestyle plan as well. Because how you choose to spend your time is just as important as how you choose to spend your dollars.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s a sad reality that the majority of us know of someone directly affected by hardship or tragedy. The death of a spouse, the permanent injury of a friend through a serious accident, a close colleague being diagnosed with a terminal illness &ndash; these are all things we don&rsquo;t like to think about. However, a recent study commissioned by the Investment Financial Services Association (ISFA) has shown that for 20% of us, it will unfortunately be something we face within our own family during our lifetime.</p>
<p>The new report reveals that one in five Australian families will be impacted by the death of a parent or a serious accident or illness that renders a parent unable to work. This equates to 18 Australian families every day.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly death, serious illness and injury are events that place enormous emotional strain on individuals and families. That strain is then often compounded by the financial burden that is the result of a family member being unable to work for a significant period of time &ndash; or in some cases permanently.</p>
<p>The scary reality is that most Australians are completely unprepared to cope with the financial strain such tragic events will likely cause. Figures show that a whopping one in two super fund members are under-insured for death cover by $100,000 or more. The figures rise even more alarmingly for total and permanent disablement (TPD) cover, with 74% underinsured by $100,000 or more (1).</p>
<h3>So how has this happened?</h3>
<p>As a nation we have historically been disengaged with the issue of life insurance. While the majority of Australians insure their car, only 31% of us actively take out insurance to protect our far more precious asset &ndash; our ability to earn an income (2). We&rsquo;ve all heard the comments like &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be right&rdquo;, &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll never happen to me&rdquo;, &ldquo;Insurance &ndash; too hard &ndash; too complicated&rdquo; but with rising household debt and more of us having children later in life, life insurance is not something we can afford to ignore any longer.</p>
<p>The way things stand currently, due to underinsurance, thousands of Australian families will be significantly impacted by avoidable financial hardship. This hardship may mean that not only do families have to learn to cope with the loss or permanent disablement of a family member but also deal with the loss of the family home and the letting go of future dreams for holidays and education choices for children.</p>
<p>One of the best assurances that a family&rsquo;s lifestyle can be maintained following such tragedy and hardship is to ensure that recommended levels of insurance are in place now. If this occurs, in most cases the family will be able to maintain a level of income the same - or close to - the level they enjoyed prior to the event, meaning essentials like mortgage and child care payments can continue to be met. It is critical that people begin to take an active interest in their super policy and take the time to review what benefits it offers and what those benefits equate to in dollar terms should the worst happen.</p>
<p>In most cases your super policy is the most cost effective and efficient means of protecting you and your family, so it makes sense to combine your insurance with your super cover.</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, insurance with your super is low cost. Most super funds get bulk discounts on their insurance rates so this in turn means cheaper premiums. In addition because your premiums are deducted directly from your member account, it&rsquo;s more tax effective.</li>
<li>Secondly, it&rsquo;s easy and accessible. Just by holding a super fund you have access to automatic default cover. As we have discussed for some people default cover is not enough but it is a good place to start.</li>
<li>Thirdly, it&rsquo;s relatively simple. Most super funds strive to provide products that are clearly and comprehensively explained in member guides. Many funds also have useful tools such as insurance needs calculators for you to determine, based on your individual circumstances, what the appropriate level of cover is for you. <br />Some super funds are attempting to meet the underinsurance challenge head on through the design and development of policies that adapt and change as people&rsquo;s life stages &ndash; and financial responsibilities - change. More cover when you have dependents and a mortgage, less cover when you&rsquo;re mortgage and dependent free. Makes sense, right?</li>
</ul>
<p>But these innovative policies do not negate the pressing need for individuals to look at their own circumstances and ask the hard question, &ldquo;How would my family cope financially if I or my partner passed away or could no longer work?&rdquo; It goes without saying that these tragic situations are difficult enough without the added burden of trying to find new ways to pay bills and meet mortgage payments. If you don&rsquo;t want that for your family, it pays to start thinking now about how you can best protect one of your most precious assets &ndash; your ability to earn an income.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>According to the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA) there are more than 400,000 super funds in Australia. With so much choice out there it&rsquo;s enough to make your head spin.</p>
<p>Not all super funds are open to everyone, nor do all of us have the choice of which fund to join. But for those of us that do, the big question is with so many funds to choose from, in what type of fund do we trust our retirement savings?</p>
<h3>The low-down on super funds</h3>
<p>Generally speaking there are five main kinds of super funds &ndash; retail funds, corporate funds, industry funds, public sector funds and Self Managed Superannuation Funds (SMSFs). They all have the same objective &ndash; look after people&rsquo;s retirement savings. It&rsquo;s how they do it and what they charge to do it that differentiates them.</p>
<p>Retail super funds are usually run by large financial institutions (banks, financial planning outfits and insurance companies) on a for-profit basis. They generally charge investors higher fees than most other funds and may pay commissions to financial planners.</p>
<p>Corporate funds or employer-sponsored super funds are only available to employees of a particular company.</p>
<p>Similar to corporate funds are public sector funds. As the name suggests these funds are set up specifically for public sector employees. The rules governing these funds are usually established by an Act of Parliament.</p>
<p>Self Managed Super Funds are DIY funds. In recent years they have grown in popularity as more and more people decide to take responsibility for managing their retirement savings into their own hands. However managing your own SMSF is no walk in the park. It is usually only recommended for people who have at least $200,000 in super and who have the time and expertise (or the funds to pay for the expertise) to run their own fund. Unlike other super funds who are regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), SMSFs are regulated by the ATO and involve strict and complex compliance and tax obligations that can be time consuming and costly to manage.</p>
<p>Traditionally industry funds or not-for-profit funds were established to cater to the needs of people working in a specific industry or a group of similar industries. Industry funds operate in direct competition to retail funds and have a very different philosophy when it comes to managing member&rsquo;s money. They are run only to profit members, charge low fees and do not pay commissions to financial advisers.</p>
<h3>The great rivalry &ndash; retail versus industry funds</h3>
<p>When it comes to superannuation there has always been a great rivalry between retail funds and industry funds.</p>
<p>Retail funds have long considered themselves to be the best in the business. For many years they have argued in favour of higher fees in return for higher returns. And for many years that was ok because they performed better that industry funds and people didn&rsquo;t mind paying for better returns.</p>
<p>But wind the clock forward to today and their position as the best has been challenged by the industry funds sector. In fact performance data from APRA released in March has shown that despite performing well last financial year, in the five years to 30 June 2009, retail funds have been outperformed by their industry fund counterparts. It would seem after many years retail funds are starting to lose some of their shine and many Australians are asking why they&rsquo;re paying more in return for less?</p>
<p>If your super is currently isn&rsquo;t invested in an industry fund, what are you waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>They&rsquo;re run only to benefit members</strong> - Industry funds are run only to benefit members. This means all profits are returned to members rather than to shareholders.</p>
<p><strong>They don&rsquo;t pay out your earnings in commissions</strong> &ndash; Unlike their retail rivals, industry funds do not pay commissions to financial planners. While this makes them unpopular within financial planning circles &ndash; planners almost never recommend industry funds to clients - it may also provide more money for members.</p>
<p><strong>Lower fees won&rsquo;t eat into your super savings</strong> &ndash; Industry funds generally charge lower fees than the average retail fund. And given that industry funds have closed the performance gap, why would you want to pay higher fees for a lower return?</p>]]></mainContent>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>This month we have asked our financial planning partner Industry Funds Financial Planning (IFFP) to discuss how to choose where to invest your super savings.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard the story about not putting all your eggs in one basket. This well-known adage reflects the concept of safety in diversification, spreading around the risks inherent in any investments. This is a great starting point for investing.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s also important is working out which baskets to place your money into. There are so many investment options and it can be difficult to know how to choose the right ones.</p>
<p>To explore this from another angle, let&rsquo;s say you are setting up a stall for the local school fete. It&rsquo;s a springtime event and your stall is permitted to sell two items. You&rsquo;ve narrowed the options down to ice creams, hot dogs, coffee and frozen lemonade.</p>
<p>Which ones would you choose? Whichever way you go, you can probably guess that the weather on the day will have a big impact on how much you can sell.</p>
<p>With this in mind, choosing, say, ice creams and coffee, might give you a good chance of having a busy day, regardless of the weather conditions.</p>
<p>If a very hot day is forecast, ice-cream and frozen lemonade may maximise the return from your stall. If a sudden cold snap strikes, hot-dogs and hot coffee would more likely be in demand.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same with investing. Remember that diversification is not just about throwing your money around haphazardly into as many baskets as you can find in order to spread your risk. In the above example, ice creams and hot coffee will do well in different conditions, and different types of investments will likewise do well at different times in the economic cycle.</p>
<h3>How much in each basket?</h3>
<p>Most investment opportunities can be split broadly into five main areas or &ldquo;asset classes&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shares or equities (managed funds and direct share holdings)</li>
<li>Property (the family home, investment properties or property funds)</li>
<li>Fixed interest (bonds)</li>
<li>Cash</li>
<li>Alternative investments (ie. infrastructure - transport, telecommunications and utilities)</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to superannuation, most of us have a combination of each of these asset classes in our individual member account. If you haven&rsquo;t made an active investment choice with your super, you will most likely be in the &ldquo;Default Option&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This will usually include a pre-mixed combination of differing assets, including local and international shares and property, fixed interest or cash and infrastructure or private equity investments.</p>
<p>This is how your fund trustee diversifies your overall investment portfolio within a fund to reduce risk and maximise your returns. The diversification principles (not keeping all your eggs in one basket) should also apply when you are considering investment options outside of super.</p>
<p>For example, we know that cash is generally a less risky, stable investment when compared with shares. Therefore if you are a conservative investor, or have a short timeframe before you need to draw out your funds, you are likely to prefer a much higher portion of your money in cash through savings accounts or term deposits.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are comfortable with higher risk and direct exposure to markets, there are additional options. If you have the investment horizon to wait through the inevitable market cycles, there are options available in a managed fund or other pooled investments. If your tolerance for risk is even higher, then you may consider direct investment in a single company.</p>
<p>Ultimately, your investment portfolio needs to be tailored to your personal circumstances and goals. Speak to your financial planner for assistance or contact your super fund to learn more about the superannuation investment options and develop a comprehensive investment portfolio as part of planning for the future.</p>
<h3>What is an Investment Portfolio?</h3>
<p>Your Investment Portfolio simply refers to where your total financial wealth is situated.</p>
<p>On what assets does your future financial wellbeing depend?</p>
<p>For many people, the main aspects of a portfolio will be their home (property), their superannuation benefits and maybe some cash savings or a small parcel of shares.<br />It&rsquo;s important to know how much you rely on each of these investments, and how well they are spread around in order to meet your future needs effectively.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Every New Year&rsquo;s Eve, people talk about the changes they&rsquo;re going to make in the New Year. Invariably it&rsquo;s always a different take on the same resolution - to drink less, work out more, lose weight or eat more vegetables. But how many of us, when the clock strikes 12, vow that this year is going to be the year that we finally get our finances in order?</p>
<p>Even though NYE is now over, it&rsquo;s not too late to sort out your finances (as well as your health). Here are a few tips to help get you started.</p>
<h3>Set yourself a goal</h3>
<p>Most investors will be happy to see the back of 2009, the year of the GFC, and welcome the possibilities that 2010 brings. And while nobody knows for sure what 2010 holds it&rsquo;s important that you understand what you want to achieve this year. Are you saving to buy a house? Do you want to reduce your debt? Or do you want to plan for your future?</p>
<p>Once you know what your goal is, it&rsquo;ll be easier to work out what you need to do to achieve it.</p>
<h3>Reduce your debt</h3>
<p>Now that Christmas and the New Year are over, it won&rsquo;t be long before your credit card bill arrives in the mail. It&rsquo;s probably a good idea to sit down and take a few deep breaths before you open your bill (or bills depending on how many credit cards you have). If your festive season spending has seen you rack up a debt the size of a small third world country all is not lost. There are ways you can reduce your debt.</p>
<p>If your only debt is your credit card, try paying it all off within the interest free period. If you can&rsquo;t, try to at least pay off more than the minimum monthly payment each month. This will help reduce your debt sooner and reduce the amount of interest you pay.</p>
<p>If you have several different types of debt - home loans, car loans, store cards and/or credit cards - you might benefit from consolidating them into one loan. This can make your debt easier to manage (as you&rsquo;ll be paying one repayment rather than many) and if you stick to your payment plan you could find that you&rsquo;ve paid you debt off faster and saved a ton on interest. You should speak to your bank or a financial adviser to see if this solution is appropriate for your situation.</p>
<h3>Draw up a budget (and stick to it)</h3>
<p>In the age of credit cards and personal loans, many people fall into the trap of spending more than they earn. You don&rsquo;t have to be Einstein to know that this way of life has some serious flaws!</p>
<p>Your budget doesn&rsquo;t need to be fancy but it should show you what you earn and what you need to put away each week, fortnight or month to cover your bills and living expenses. The Government&rsquo;s Understanding Money website (<a href="http://www.understandingmoney.gov.au/" target="_blank">www.understandingmoney.gov.au</a>) has some good tips on how to draw up a budget.</p>
<h3>Check your insurance</h3>
<p>You probably already have car, health and home and contents insurance but do you have life or income protection insurance?</p>
<p>You might not think you need these types of insurance and you might be right. But ask yourself this &ndash; if you died or were unable to work (either for a short period or indefinitely) would you or your family be able to manage without your wage? Would the mortgage and household bills get paid? Would the school fees or medical bills get paid? If the answer is no, life and income protection insurance can offer some piece of mind that things will be taken care of if the unexpected happens.</p>
<p>If you are considering taking out life and/or income protection insurance it&rsquo;s a good idea to speak to your super fund. Super funds have a group policy which means premiums are generally cheaper than if you were to approach an insurance company directly. Also there are a number of tax advantages to paying your insurance premiums through your super fund.</p>
<h3>Care about your super</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;re serious about getting your finances in order, you can&rsquo;t afford to overlook your super. Your super is supposed to provide a nest egg for you when you retire so it&rsquo;s important that you do what you can while you&rsquo;re still working to maximise your savings.</p>
<p>Familiarise yourself with your super. What&rsquo;s your account balance? Do you have more than one account? Do you know where your super is invested? Are you entitled to a co-contribution? If you have no idea, you could be missing out on some great opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Consider consolidating your super accounts</strong> &ndash; If you have more than one super account it&rsquo;s worth consolidating them into one. This way you&rsquo;ll stop paying multiple fees and your super will have a higher base from which to grow.</p>
<p><strong>Make an investment choice</strong> &ndash; The majority of Australian&rsquo;s have their super invested in their super fund&rsquo;s balanced investment option. While this may be fine for most, it&rsquo;s worth reviewing your investment options to see if there&rsquo;s one better suited to your investment horizon (the amount of time your money will be invested) and your risk profile.</p>
<p><strong>Give your super a helping hand</strong> &ndash; Making regular or one-off contributions to your super account is a great way to boost your super savings. Plus, if you&rsquo;re eligible you could qualify for a government co-contribution of up to $1,000.</p>
<h3>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for help</h3>
<p>If you find the worlds of investing, budgeting, insurance and superannuation harder to understand than an excited Scotsman (apologies to any Scottish readers), don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for help. Independent financial advisers can help you navigate your way through the different investing options, help you understand your attitudes towards risk and suggest a financial plan to help you reach your financial goals.</p>
<p>Again, if you need some help give your super fund a call. Most have arrangements with financial advisers and offer members discounted consultation rates.</p>]]></mainContent>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s unnerving thinking about risks, but as a business person you know that thinking ahead is necessary. With that principle in mind, what would happen to your business if you or a business partner were forced to withdraw from the running of the business entirely?</p>
<p>Such a situation could occur if a medical trauma such as an illness or injury left you or a business partner permanently incapacitated, or if you or a business partner unexpectedly died. This is a fundamental issue that faces any business and depending on your circumstances, there may be serious repercussions.</p>
<h3>Debts</h3>
<p>Your business may have debts. If you or a business partner suddenly dies, could the business afford to continue to pay those debts if a key person is no longer generating revenue?</p>
<p>In this scenario it would help if you had transferred the debt risk by having the debt insured. That means if you or a business partner become incapacitated, a lump sum can be paid by the insurance company to clear those debts and the remaining partner can run the business unencumbered by financial burden.</p>
<h3>Buy/sell agreements</h3>
<p>If you are in a partnership arrangement, what happens to the ownership of the business if you or a business partner dies?<br />One scenario sees you continue to run the business in conjunction with the deceased partner&rsquo;s spouse, who would effectively become a part owner. But would this be a desirable situation for all concerned?</p>
<p>Another possibility is for the remaining partner use a lump sum to buy out the other share of the business. In this event, will that lump sum come from a loan? If so, can the business or the parties borrowing afford that loan?</p>
<p>With insurance, the money paid out in the event of the death or disablement could be used to buy out the other partner&rsquo;s share, leaving 100 per cent ownership with one person.</p>
<h3>Key person insurance</h3>
<p>Another important issue is the effect that the loss of a &lsquo;key person&rsquo; will have on the future operation of the business. A &lsquo;key person&rsquo; is someone who generates a significant portion of the business&rsquo; revenue or who has a critical role to play.</p>
<p>In this situation, you might be in a better position to adjust to the necessary changes if you had transferred the risk to an insurance company, by insuring against the loss of the key person.</p>
<p>An insurance payout in this situation would provide a lump sum injection into the business that may be used to source a new person to bring the business back into operation.</p>
<h3>Business Continuity</h3>
<p>Another area that needs to be considered by businesses when taking out insurance is &ldquo;Business Continuity&rdquo;. This means that the shareholders&rsquo; agreement takes into consideration all situations that may arise that need insuring through a Buy/Sell agreement such as &ldquo;default&rdquo; events.</p>
<p>Many businesses would be insured for an event such as death but many wouldn&rsquo;t be insured to cover a default event such as insolvency, so it is imperative to make sure the shareholders agreement covers all possibilities.</p>
<h3>Estate planning</h3>
<p>Proper estate planning is important in a business to ensure your commercial assets are distributed to your beneficiaries the way you want them to be, if and when you die.</p>
<p>For example, if not all members of your family are interested in being involved in the business, but you want to ensure an equal distribution of assets when you die, you need to take steps to ensure this.</p>
<p>Estate equalisation ensures that if something were to happen to you, your business can remain intact for those that want to be involved, while those not wanting to be involved can receive an equal value in the form of a life insurance policy.</p>
<h3>What&rsquo;s the best way to prepare?</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s better to consider all these issues as a whole, and put in place a strategic plan.</p>
<p>For example, your strategy may include covering debts and expenses, having a succession plan to pay out surviving partners for their share of the business and key person insurance to ensure it keeps running. There&rsquo;s also the finalisation factor if you have a business of value and want to pass that on to the next generation.</p>
<p>Then there are structures to put in place to maximise tax benefits. Depending on the structures already in place, some premiums are deductible and some are not. However, there are ways to structure your policy so tax is minimised. It&rsquo;s particularly important to ensure that ownership structures and premium payments are approached correctly to avoid any capital gains tax.</p>
<h3>A demonstration of the various issues at play</h3>
<p>For example - most businesses will have some sort of Key Person insurance which will take effect should a business partner pass away. The company that owns the policy will receive a benefit that will cover the whole value of the deceased partner&rsquo;s share of the business, or part of it, with the rest covered by the surviving partner.</p>
<p>What many businesses don&rsquo;t consider is the CGT that would be payable by the estate once the funds have been received.<br />One possibility to reduce the CGT component is a &ldquo;Contract to Will&rdquo;: The partners contract to will over their share of the business to the value of the insurance policy. By implementing this strategy, the deceased&rsquo;s estate doesn&rsquo;t pay CGT on the policy payout and the living partner doesn&rsquo;t have to pay out the Estate but retains the business (it is worth noting that with this strategy the partners would have to review the life policies annually to make sure they are keeping up with the value of the business).</p>
<p>This example demonstrates that by considering the various issues together rather in isolation, a more complete insurance strategy can be devised.</p>
<h3>What insurances can be used?</h3>
<p>Many people are familiar with personal insurances such as life, income, trauma, total and permanent disability, and business expenses insurance, which can be purchased to provide financial protection for individuals from common risks, such as injury, illness or death.</p>
<p>However, what&rsquo;s less commonly understood is that these same personal insurances can also be used to protect your business, if set up in the right way.</p>
<p>Superannuation can also be a tax effective way to provide some of the insurance requirements.</p>
<h3>What should you do next?</h3>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Nobody likes paying bank fees &ndash; it&rsquo;s one of the main reasons most of us only have one bank account. The same should apply to our super but sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t. Ironically, while we&rsquo;re happy to whinge about bank fees, 80% of Australian&rsquo;s continue to pay multiple sets of fees on super accounts that in most cases they don&rsquo;t really need and often don&rsquo;t even know they have.</p>
<p>When you look at these costs over time, we&rsquo;re talking thousands of dollars wasted on fees. So, if the number of super funds you have is roughly the same as the number of jobs you&rsquo;ve ever had, it&rsquo;s time think about consolidating.</p>
<h3>Q. What are the benefits to consolidating my super?</h3>
<p>By tracking down and consolidating your super into one account, you&rsquo;ll stop paying unnecessary additional fees and have more money in your account. More money means a higher earnings base and more for you to enjoy when you retire. Consolidation also makes it easier for you to manage and keep track of your retirement savings.</p>
<h3>Q. How much could I save by consolidating my super?</h3>
<p>What you save will obviously depend on your personal circumstances but let&rsquo;s say have money invested in four different super funds. For the three funds you are no longer contributing to, you&rsquo;re being charged $300 a year in account fees. In five years you&rsquo;ll have paid $1,500 and after 30 years a whopping $9,000 in additional fees. And that doesn&rsquo;t even include the interest you will have foregone on this amount.</p>
<p>By consolidating all of your accounts into one, you&rsquo;ll pay one fee and the money you save will provide a higher base for you to enjoy in retirement.</p>
<h3>Q. Are there any things I need to consider before I consolidate?</h3>
<p>Insurance benefits - Before you consolidate, you should review your insurance arrangements. Most people generally have some form of default insurance cover with their super. Let&rsquo;s say you have three super funds and have three lots of default cover. If you become entitled to a payout, you&rsquo;ll generally get a paid from each of your three insurance policies. But when you consolidate your super, your insurance cover in the funds you consolidate will lapse and you&rsquo;ll be left with only one lot of insurance cover.</p>
<p>When you consolidate, you may need to increase your level of cover to ensure you&rsquo;ll have enough if and when you need it. You should also be aware that you may be required to undergo medical tests if you apply for additional cover.</p>
<p>Exit Fees &ndash; Some funds charge a hefty exit fee if you try to move your money into another fund. If this is the case, you might not benefit from the transfer.</p>
<p>Selecting the right super fund &ndash; When people do consolidate, they generally roll their super into the fund that they are currently contributing to. While this is the easiest option, you might like to compare all the funds before deciding. Which one has the lowest fees? Which one has the best insurance cover? Which one has the best returns over the medium-longer term?</p>
<h3>Q. What do I need to do to consolidate my super?</h3>
<p>There are generally three steps to consolidate your super.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Track down all your different super accounts. If you&rsquo;ve lost contact with your old funds or have no idea where your money is, there are a couple of ways you can find them:</li>
<ul>
<li>Search the ATO&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au/superseeker" target="_blank">Super Seeker</a> website. All you need is your name, date of birth and tax file number.</li>
<li>Contact your old employers. They&rsquo;ll be able to tell you where they paid your super entitlements.</li>
<li>Search the ASIC <a href="http://www.asic.gov.au/unclaimedmoney" target="_blank">Lost Monies Register</a> or the Lost Monies Register in your state.</li>
</ul>
<li>Once you have the details of your accounts you need to decide which fund you want to roll them all into. You will need to fill in a separate consolidation form for each account you want to consolidate. You can usually download consolidation forms from your chosen fund&rsquo;s website or you can contact them and ask them to post it to you.</li>
<li>Send your completed forms to your chosen super fund together with certified copies of your identification (your driver&rsquo;s licence or passport is usually the easiest) and they&rsquo;ll do the rest.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Q. Why do I have to get my documents certified?</h3>
<p>Although it can be time consuming to get your original identification documents certified, it&rsquo;s a legal requirement that super funds must comply with to make sure everything is kosher with your consolidation request.</p>
<p>There are lots of people who are qualified to certify your documents. So the next time you need to visit your local post office, doctor&rsquo;s surgery, pharmacy, bank or police station, kill two birds with one stone and take along your documents for certifying. Just make sure you take in the original and the copies.</p>
<h3>Q. What happens if I change jobs?</h3>
<p>Just because you change jobs doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to change super funds. Most Australian&rsquo;s are able to choose which fund their super contributions are paid into. If you change jobs, simply give your super fund membership details to your new employer.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Not many people wake up in the morning and think about all the things that could go wrong. In fact, Australians are a pretty optimistic bunch and our positive attitude has helped us weather many storms.</p>
<p>But research from the Investment and Financial Services Association (IFSA) has revealed that our &lsquo;she&rsquo;ll be right&rsquo; attitude has left many of us financially vulnerable when things do go wrong. We even have the dubious honour of being one of the most underinsured nations in the developed world.</p>
<p>Even when we are insured, it&rsquo;s not often enough</p>
<p>Life insurance claims figures released by the IFSA show Australian families received an average payout of just $91,000 on the death of their partner in 2008.</p>
<p>According to IFSA&rsquo;s deputy CEO John O&rsquo;Shaughnessy, $91,000 is not enough especially when you consider that the average Australian family with young children has debts totalling $167,000.</p>
<p>Average payouts for total and permanent disablement during 2008 tell a similar story with nearly $71,000 paid out on average to Australians who were disabled and unable to work again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you consider the fact that with many disabilities you cannot work or earn an income again, not to mention the care and home modification costs and ongoing living expenses, these levels of coverage are simply not sufficient,&rdquo; says John.</p>
<h3>She&rsquo;ll be right, right?</h3>
<p>Not always.</p>
<p>If you injure yourself and are unable to work, could you afford to live without your salary? How long could you survive before being unable to pay your mortgage or rent, essential bills, school fees or medical costs?</p>
<p>And what about if you died? Would your family be able to pay for your funeral or medical expenses? Would the mortgage and other household bills still get paid?</p>
<p>If the answer to any of these questions is no, you should really consider protecting your family&rsquo;s financial security and speak to a professional about your insurance options.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ok, I&rsquo;ve got insurance through my super</p>
<p>While it&rsquo;s true that most Australians will have some default cover through their super fund, it&rsquo;s important to review your level of cover regularly so that it&rsquo;s right for your circumstances. If you find that you require more protection than your default cover provides, you can apply to increase your level of cover through your super fund.</p>
<h3>Review your level of cover regularly</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to review your level of insurance if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have recently married or divorced</li>
<li>Have recently had a child or grandchild</li>
<li>Have refinanced your home mortgage in the past six months</li>
<li>Have recently bought a new home</li>
<li>Provide care or financial help to a child or parent</li>
<li>Want to ensure that financial resources are available to provide assistance or long-term care for a loved one</li>
<li>Have received a lump sum of any kind including an inheritance or redundancy package</li>
<li>Have retired or your spouse has retired</li>
<li>Have started a business</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ok, so how much is enough?</h3>
<p>The answer will depend on your individual circumstances, but some basic principles apply.</p>
<p>Working out the right amount of life insurance requires you to think about how much you would need to pay off all debts, how much money you&rsquo;ll need to pay funeral costs, and how much you&rsquo;d like to leave your family to meet their future financial obligations if you were to die.</p>
<p>According to IFSA and the Australian Bankers Association , full-time workers in their mid 30&rsquo;s with young children generally need at least 10 times their taxable earnings in life cover. So if a person earns $50,000 a year, they may consider covering themselves for at least $500,000. However, working out the right amount of insurance will depend on the person&rsquo;s individual circumstances.</p>
<h3>What types of <a href="/{localLink:1601}" title="Your insurance options">cover</a> are available?</h3>
<p>Death cover: provides you with a lump sum if you become terminally ill or a lump sum to your family when you die.</p>
<p>Total and permanent disablement (TPD) cover: provides you with a lump sum if you are totally and permanently disabled.</p>
<p>Income protection insurance: provides you with up to 75% of your regular income for up to two years if you have an illness or injury that prevents you from working.</p>
<p>Some super funds, like Prime Super, also offer members access to other types of insurance. These include:</p>
<p>Trauma insurance: provides you with a lump sum if you suffer one of a number of specified medical conditions.</p>
<p>Private health insurance: may cover the cost for your treatment as a private patient in a private or public hospital and can include rebates on some services that Medicare does not cover, such as dental care, most optical care and ambulance transport.</p>
<p>It makes sense to take out insurance cover through your super fund.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's low cost &ndash; Generally super funds get bulk discount insurance rates so your premiums are cheaper. Plus because your premiums can be deducted directly from your super fund member account, it's more tax effective.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s accessible &ndash; As a member of a super fund, you generally have access to automatic default cover without having to do anything other than join as a member.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s simple &ndash; The products are easy to understand.</li>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>New research suggests that Australia&rsquo;s super system inherently disadvantages women and that when women do retire, they do so with less than half the super savings of their male counterparts. Given that women typically live longer than men, this means they have to survive longer on less. But is it just our super system at fault or do our laws and our attitudes towards women and their role in society also contribute to the inequity?</p>
<p>Research from the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) argues that there are two main reasons our super system disadvantages women &ndash; women take time out from the workforce and they often earn less than men in a wide range of careers.</p>
<p>The Australian super system is designed to reward long and continuous periods of employment. Unlike the majority of men, women tend to have broken employment patterns often moving in and out of the workforce as they have children, raise families or take on other family responsibilities.</p>
<p>Added to this is despite the fact that we live in an age of so called equal pay, women still get paid less than men (according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the gender pay gap has widened to 17.53%). This directly affects the amount put aside for retirement. Women also tend to be over-represented amongst low-paid and casual workers. These workers often don&rsquo;t meet the earnings threshold that applies to super and sometimes have no super at all.<br /> <br />In the farming sector, many women are self-employed. The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA) estimates that nearly one third of self-employed business owners have no super and of those that do, 53% have a balance of less than $53,000.</p>
<p>With all of these factors stacked up against them, it&rsquo;s not hard to see why some women might see our super system as anything but super.</p>
<h3>Bridging the gap</h3>
<p>According to the ASFA, the average retirement payout for women is only $73,000 compared to $155,000 for men.</p>
<p>The picture is even worse for divorced women who have to rely on their own resources in retirement. ASFA estimates that recently divorced women currently have around $40,000 in super compared to around $145,000 for men.</p>
<p>If we are to address this problem, argues Dr Anup Basu, author of the research QUT&rsquo;s School of Economic, we should aim to make our super system more gender sensitive.</p>
<p>He calls for a two pronged approach &ndash; firstly to increase the mandatory contribution rate for women to at least 12% (15-16% would be ideal) and secondly to encourage women, who are traditionally less risk averse than men, to invest in high growth strategies, particularly if they have many years before they retire. This approach is likely to cause much discussion as government, employers, super funds and the community debate whether the approach is practical, fair and more importantly, who pays for any increase in mandatory contributions.</p>
<p>ASFA and the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees (AIST) both agree that reforms are needed. Both are seeking to lower or remove the monthly income threshold that disadvantages many part-time and casual workers, while AIST is calling for a &lsquo;Super Baby Bonus&rsquo; for women who leave the workforce to have a baby.</p>
<p>ASFA has also proposed a number of reforms to help restore some gender balance to our super system. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raising the income threshold for the government co-contribution so that more individuals in the lower/middle income groups can qualify for the full amount.</li>
<li>Introducing &lsquo;soft compulsion&rsquo; on employee contributions.</li>
<li>Encouraging or requiring employers to help employees contribute an additional one per cent of salary or wages into super each time they receive a wage increase or start a new job, up to a maximum of 3%.</li>
</ul>
<h3>It&rsquo;s not just the super system</h3>
<p>If we are serious about addressing the issue of inequitable retirement savings, it&rsquo;s not just the super system that needs to change. We need to place greater value on the work &ndash; both paid and unpaid - that women undertake. We also need to review our workplace and maternity laws to ensure that women are not disadvantaged if they take time off work to have a family.</p>
<p>Maybe as a society we need to insist that the government&rsquo;s 18 week funded maternity leave scheme is subject to compulsory super contributions. Maybe we need to have part of the baby bonus paid directly into women&rsquo;s super accounts. And maybe we need to ensure that equal pay actually means equal pay, especially for comparative work.</p>
<h3>How to boost your super savings</h3>
<p>While we wait with bated breath to see whether these suggested reforms gather momentum, here are some ways that individuals &ndash; male or female - can boost their super balance now.</p>
<h3>Get your spouse to top up your super</h3>
<p>If your partner earns more than you do, they can help boost your account balance by splitting certain super contributions with you. Contact your super fund to see if they can facilitate contribution splitting. The ATO limits how much you can split with your spouse so check their <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au/super" target="_blank">website</a> for the current thresholds.</p>
<h3>Salary sacrifice into your super</h3>
<p>When you salary sacrifice, you reduce your pre-tax salary and pay that amount as extra super contributions. Salary sacrificing is a popular way to boost super savings because, as well as increasing your savings, you also reduce your taxable income which means you may save on income tax.</p>
<h3>Take advantage of government co-contributions&hellip;</h3>
<p>As an incentive to get people thinking about their super, the government will dollar match all post-tax contributions you make to your super fund up to a maximum of $1,000. So if you earn less than $60,342 a year you could be eligible to receive up to $1,000 in super contributions from the Government. The amount of the co-contribution you receive will depend on your income and the amount you have paid as a personal contribution to your super fund.</p>
<h3>&hellip; and the spouse tax offset</h3>
<p>If you earn less than $13,800 a year, your spouse may be able to claim an 18% tax offset on super contributions of up to $3,000 they make to your super fund on your behalf.</p>
<h3>Review your investment strategy</h3>
<p>If you want to increase your super savings it could be worth reviewing where your money is invested. If you can stomach the risk, it might be beneficial moving to a high growth strategy, especially if you&rsquo;ve got a number of years to go before you retire.</p>
<h3>Get financial advice</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s always a good idea to speak to an independent financial advisor before making any major financial decisions. An advisor will be able to help you assess your tolerance to risk and prepare a financial strategy that is suitable for you and your long-term goals.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Are you getting all your super entitlements?]]></title>
            <summary><![CDATA[According to the Australian Taxation Office, the squeeze on revenue has led to some employers neglecting their Superannuation Guarantee (SG) obligations.]]></summary>
            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>According to the Australian Taxation Office, the squeeze on revenue has led to some employers neglecting their Superannuation Guarantee (SG) obligations.</p>
<p>Employers are required by law to pay super contributions (known as SG) to all eligible employees and these savings are on the same ranking as wages when it comes to employee entitlements. If an employer is late with a payment or does not make a payment at all, it can potentially jeopardise the retirement outcomes for employees.</p>
<p>Superannuation contributions must be paid by specified dates that are determined by the ATO. There are harsh penalties for employers who do not comply with these deadlines. The remaining dates for 2009/10 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>28 October 2009</li>
<li>28 January 2010</li>
<li>28 April 2010</li>
</ul>
<p>If you suspect that your super may not have been paid correctly, there a number of things you can do.</p>
<ol>
<li>Talk to your employer. Ask them how often they are paying your super, how much and into which fund. It&rsquo;s a good idea to ask these sorts of questions when you first start work.</li>
<li>Make sure you are eligible to receive super. Usually an employer has to pay super contributions for you if you are under 70 years old and if you are paid at least $450 in salary and wages (before tax) a month. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you work casual, part-time or full-time hours. However if you are under 18 years you must work more than 30 hours per week.</li>
<li>Know your entitlements. If you are a contractor, your employer may have to make super contributions for you if you are paid under a contract that is wholly or principally for labour - even if you have an ABN. If the contract is partly for labour and partly for something else (for example, the supply of goods, materials or hire of plant or machinery), it will still be a contract for labour if it is principally for labour. 'Labour' includes mental and artistic effort as well as physical work.</li>
<li>Check your last member statement from your super fund, or contact them to confirm if your employer has paid your super.</li>
<li>If you have established a salary sacrifice arrangement make sure that your employer is not using these contributions to offset their obligation to pay their SG.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you still believe your employer is not paying you enough or any super, or is not paying the super to your chosen fund, you can lodge an enquiry about unpaid super with the ATO by calling them on 13 10 20. They also have a useful online calculator that you can use to check if you are getting paid enough super.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>With the recent turmoil in investment markets many people are asking whether they should start or continue with a self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF or DIY fund).</p>
<p>If you are considering a SMSF, here are some important questions you should ask yourself.</p>
<h3>Why are you considering a SMSF?</h3>
<p>SMSF&rsquo;s are tightly regulated by the Australian Tax Office (ATO). If you were hoping to use a SMSF for any purpose other than to genuinely plan for income in retirement you could find yourself in trouble with the ATO.</p>
<p>This means you can&rsquo;t use your SMSF for financing a business, buying a holiday home or paying off your mortgage.</p>
<h3>Do you have the time, money and expertise?</h3>
<p>People who understand investment markets and put time into managing their investments can do well with a SMSF. So can those who are willing to pay for qualified independent advice.</p>
<p>But if you have neither the time, the money, or the interest to delve into investment matters then a SMSF might not be the right option for you.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that SMSFs involve strict and complex compliance and tax obligations that can be time consuming and costly to manage.</p>
<h3>Do the costs stack up?</h3>
<p>It is generally accepted that SMSFs can be expensive to run, but sometimes the costs can be worthwhile.</p>
<p>After paying the initial establishment expenses of a SMSF, there are further base and optional costs involved in maintaining your fund.</p>
<p>When you take into account costs such as audit, advice and administration, SMSFs generally don&rsquo;t become cost effective until the level of assets start to approach $200,000.</p>
<p>On the other hand, whether the costs stack up or not, can be a matter of personal preference. You might think it&rsquo;s worthwhile paying more in costs to gain greater control over where your money is invested. That&rsquo;s a personal judgement, though it may still be wise to know where you stand on the basis of a pure cost comparison.</p>
<h3>How DIY will your fund be?</h3>
<p>Unless you&rsquo;re a registered auditor with investment experience and time to plan your investments, a SMSF will never be a true DIY experience.</p>
<p>Before taking on a SMSF you should identify all of the roles involved and decide which ones you want to manage yourself. This will also give you a good idea of the operating costs and your time commitment.</p>
<h3>What about insurance?</h3>
<p>The super fund you&rsquo;re with now might offer insurance on terms that may not be available to a SMSF.</p>
<p>If insurance is important to you, you should find out whether you can take your current insurance with you to your SMSF.</p>
<h3>How much control will you have?</h3>
<p>People who make SMSFs work for them are often those who like being hands on and understand how to use this control to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Ask yourself if you have a real wish to gain close control over your investments as well as the knowledge and experience to make this level of involvement work for you.</p>
<p>It is true that a clever trustee can generate tax advantages, particularly during the move from the accumulation to pension phase, however there are pitfalls. So if you do decide to start your own SMSF, make sure you go into it with your eyes open and you have a sound plan.</p>
<h3>I would like a SMSF but what if I don&rsquo;t have enough assets.</h3>
<p>If the idea of a SMSF appeals to you but you don&rsquo;t have enough super savings to make it cost effective, you can use an existing super fund as an incubator until you have built up enough money to start your own.</p>
<p>Then when you have accumulated enough assets you can transfer your savings to a SMSF.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Are Super investments on the road to recovery?]]></title>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Australians will receive their annual Super statements soon and the news is not good. After getting used to years of extremely positive results they have now faced two consecutive years of negative returns.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s caused this bad run and what can we expect in the next couple of years? If you&rsquo;ve read a newspaper or watched the news in the last couple of years, you&rsquo;ll certainly know that we&rsquo;re in the middle of a global financial crisis (GFC) &ndash; the most volatile set of investment conditions since the 1987 stock market crash.</p>
<p>The original cause of the GFC &ndash; the US subprime crisis &ndash; occurred when US banks offered loans to people who could not afford to repay them. When these people defaulted on their repayment, the banks were forced to sell the properties - in many cases for a loss.</p>
<p>The crisis was further exacerbated when it came to light that a large percentage of these bad loans were packaged up and on-sold as &ldquo;structured&rdquo; or &ldquo;securitised&rdquo; lending products to other investment companies. It&rsquo;s these products that led to large American investment banks like Merrill Lynch and Citibank writing off tens of billions of dollars..</p>
<p>All around the world, governments have moved to limit the impact of the financial crisis. Many, including Australia introduced a range of measures such as aggressively cutting official interest rates and guaranteeing bank deposits to support vulnerable banks and financial institutions. There have also been large government stimulus packages handed out by many leading countries including Australia, the US, UK, China, Japan and Germany.</p>
<h3>What about Australia?</h3>
<p>Many economists predicted that although Australia would not be immune from the effects of the GFC, our strong banking system and our strong links to emerging economies such as China and India would shield us from the worst of the impact.</p>
<p>Although we&rsquo;ve managed to stave off an official recession, it has not been plain sailing.</p>
<p>The Australian All Ordinaries index fell 15.5% in 2007-08 and 25% in 2008-09. Unemployment increased from a low of 4.8% in August 2006 to 5.8% in July 2009. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has also cut the official interest rate by 4 basis points between September 2008 and April 2009. It has remained at 3% for the last four months, the lowest it has been for almost 50 years.</p>
<h3>The road to recovery</h3>
<p>Many economists now agree that while the global recession is far from over, we should reach the bottom by the end of the year. From there, things should start to turn around, albeit very slowly &ndash; US economist Professor Nouriel Roubini, who predicted the global financial crisis as early as 2006, is only forecasting global growth of 1% over the next two years.</p>
<p>However Roubini is optimistic that the Australian economy will largely continue to defy the global gloom, growing by 2% in 2009-10 on the proviso that China&rsquo;s stockpiling of commodities continues.</p>
<p>We are starting to see some signs that this may be the case. Although global stock markets fell 0.2% in June 2009, they also posted their first quarterly gain (16.3%) since September 2007. Closer to home, Australian share prices rose 10% for the June quarter and the Australian dollar reached a 10 month high in August climbing above $US0.84 cents.</p>
<p>The RBA has also signalled some degree of confidence that Australia is on the way back, deciding at its August meeting to leave the cash rate unchanged at 3% &ndash; the fourth month in a row that it has done so. Many experts are now predicting that interest rates will start to rise mid next year.</p>
<h3>What does this mean for super investments?</h3>
<p>The global financial crisis has not been kind to super returns. Losses experienced in the financial year ending 30 June 2008 were the first indications of the impact of the global financial crisis on listed markets.</p>
<p>The losses we are seeing in 2008-09 can be attributed to the full impact of the economic crisis across the broad spectrum of investment markets and the further downward revaluations of both listed and unlisted market assets.</p>
<p>However, despite this negativity, we need to remember that super is a long-term investment and these short-term losses, no matter how severe, can and will be recovered over the longer-term.</p>
<h3>Don&rsquo;t panic!</h3>
<p>History shows that those that stay invested recover all that was lost during the period of the downturn. Those that panic and get out of the game early, end up with none of the recovery.</p>
<p>Most Australians generally can&rsquo;t access their super savings until they are 55 so it&rsquo;s important to stay focused on long-term results. According to SelectingSuper, for the year to 30 June 2009 the annual returns for the default option (in which most people are invested) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>3.7% over 5 years</li>
<li>5.1% over 7 years</li>
<li>5.3% over 10 years</li>
</ul>
<h3>What if I&rsquo;m close to retirement?</h3>
<p>Negative returns are not what you want to see if you&rsquo;re close to retiring. If you&rsquo;re contemplating retiring soon, cashing in your super benefit now may not be the best thing to do. Other alternatives, such as converting your benefit into an Allocated pension might be a better option.</p>
<p>If you opt for an Allocated pension, your money will remain fully invested and will benefit from future recoveries in the share market. You should seek independent financial advice to see which option best suits your individual circumstances.</p>
<h3>Review your investment choice&nbsp;</h3>
<p>If negative super returns keep you up at night, you might find it worthwhile reviewing where your super is invested. Spreading your investments across all investment classes may help reduce volatility.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a good idea to invest in a sound financial plan. A financial adviser will be able to help assist you to assess your tolerance to risk, identify a mix of assets to match your individual goals and prepare a financial strategy which is suitable for you.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>With the news last week of the collapse of one of the world&rsquo;s largest investment banks, Lehman Bros, the rescue of Merrill Lynch and AIG, and with more fallout expected from the US and around the world, it is a good time to consider what this may mean for Australia and at a more personal level, for your own financial circumstances.</p>
<p>After &lsquo;Meltdown Monday&rsquo;, Australia&rsquo;s stock markets responded with further falls and we were told to expect more uncertainty particularly while global markets watch nervously to see whether the world&rsquo;s largest insurer, AIG, would survive the week. With assets estimated at $1 trillion dollars the impact of its collapse would have been significant, but was prevented by the intervention of the US Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>Subsequent news was that the US Government were also planning to take a more comprehensive approach to resolving the financial crisis and the world&rsquo;s leading banks added $228 billion to money markets in an attempt to free up credit markets and bank lending. The result was that stock markets generally recovered the previous day&rsquo;s losses and investors re-entered the market after the panic of the previous days.</p>
<p>In Australia, during the period from 2003 to mid-2007 we enjoyed investment returns which were higher than we could normally expect over the long-term. There was strong earnings growth, relatively cheap and abundant finance and inflation was under control. Since then, the global credit crunch has helped to reverse those conditions resulting in sharp falls in the share markets and high levels of defaults on loans.</p>
<p>There is a wide range of outcomes expected from these market conditions, including commentary that our Reserve Bank may respond with more reductions in mortgage interest rates &ndash; good news for most of us with home loans. As for most superannuation funds, Prime Super holds investments in international markets, including the United States, so we will continue to expect volatility in this sector. Prime Super is not insured by AIG and so the unfolding of events, including its change of ownership, will not impact the Fund or members&rsquo; benefits.</p>
<p>While there may be temptation for some of us to re-think our investment strategies, your Prime Super Trustee believes that given the unpredictability of future investment conditions, focus should remain on the medium term and maintain the portfolio as it is, as the portfolio is designed to perform well in most investment environments.</p>
<p>Shortly you will be receiving your 2008 Annual Report which will give you more details about the Trustee&rsquo;s investment strategy, investment performance, the allocation of assets to market sectors as well details of actual investments held by the Fund. One of our strong messages this year is that in all aspects of managing your Fund, Prime Super is focused on getting the basics right, employing the right resources to achieve the standards you expect and to focus on our mutual long-terms goals.</p>
<p>Saving for your retirement is a long-term strategy and we remind you that reacting to short-term conditions can be problematic. Remember, the &lsquo;rule of thumb&rsquo; that over a 10 year period your investments in shares will out-perform other market segments, but this will mean riding the short-term &lsquo;waves&rsquo;.</p>
<p>We will keep you up-to-date with news from financial markets and what it means for you, our Prime Super members.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<h3>What&rsquo;s Happened?</h3>
<p>There has been a significant amount of coverage in the media over recent months in relation to sub-prime mortgage market concerns in the US and recent moves by the Reserve Bank and most Australian financial institutions to increase interest rates. These economic conditions have made investors jumpy and created the most volatile investment conditions that we have seen for many years.</p>
<p>This uncertainty is played out in the listed stock markets. The Australian markets have been through major swings up and down over the last six months, reaching an all time high on 1 November 2007, and falling by 13.7% over the financial year. The unhedged international share market fell by 21.3% for the year.</p>
<h3>Investing in the Stock Market</h3>
<p>The stock market can be a very emotional place to invest, which can often lead to over selling or over buying. Over a large period of time these &ldquo;cycles&rdquo; become evident:</p>
<ul>
<li>October 1987 saw a significant loss on the Australian and world stock markets;</li>
<li>1999 saw huge growth in markets on the back of the &ldquo;tech boom&rdquo;;</li>
<li>2002 and 2003 saw an unwinding of the tech boom; and</li>
<li>The financial years ended 30 June 2004 through to 30 June 2007 saw very strong returns on the Australian share markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are now giving back some of these recent gains.</p>
<p>Things to Remember</p>
<p>History shows that the stock markets rise and fall, sometimes dramatically. It is very important not to become emotional when investing. For example, those investors that stayed fully invested during the stock market crash of 1987 recovered all funds that were lost and benefited from the subsequent recovery, whilst those that sold out got none of the recovery.</p>
<h3>What does this mean for your Super?</h3>
<p>As a super investor you generally can&rsquo;t access your money until you are 55 or older. This means you should stay focused on long term returns.</p>
<p>It is also important to remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Volatility is something that is expected on the share market;</li>
<li>We have just had four consecutive years of very strong returns.</li>
<li>History shows that markets tend to over estimate the real impact of information;</li>
<li>If you can wait out the downturn, history shows that you will recover these losses in the long term;</li>
<li>History also shows that in the long term markets recover, we just don&rsquo;t know how long that will take.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Nearing Retirement?</h3>
<p>Such large adverse movements in the market are not what you need if you are nearing retirement. Cashing out your benefits now may not be the best thing to do. There are other alternatives, such as converting your benefits into an allocated pension.<br />Rather than cashing your benefit out now, it may be better to remain fully invested, and transfer your benefit to an allocated pension. By so doing you allow your funds to remain fully invested, and benefit from future recoveries in the share market. If you are considering any such change it is important to seek independent financial advice.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<h3>The &ldquo;Sub-Prime Crisis&rdquo;</h3>
<p>There has been a significant amount of coverage in the media over recent months in relation to the sub-prime mortgage market concerns in the US, the move by most Australian financial institutions to increase interest rates, the collapse of the Australian Centro Properties Group and general doom and gloom about the prospects for financial markets in general.</p>
<p>The combination of all these factors has lead to an increase in uncertainty about the economic future of Australia and of the world economy in general. This uncertainty is played out in the listed stock markets. The Australian markets have been through major swings up and down over the last six months, reaching an all time high on 1 November 2007, and dropping by almost 15% by the middle of January 2008. In the jargon of the investment world this is called volatility.</p>
<p>The catalyst for this increased volatility was the US sub-prime lending market. (Sub-prime loans are loans to borrowers that do not qualify for the best interest rates available as a result of a poor credit history). There has been a marked rise in the number of defaults and delinquencies in the sub-prime market, (i.e. borrowers that can&rsquo;t meet their repayments), and with a total of US $1.3 trillion of outstanding sub-prime loans, there is concern that those parties invested in the sub-prime market will lose money on those investments. The outflow of these concerns has been a drive to increase the profitability on other loans and a need to pass on the increased cost of funding, by increasing interest rates, or to sell out of the loan packages and cut the potential losses. The US based financial institutions that invest in these sub-prime loans therefore have significantly reduced profit expectations. This is all against a backdrop of increasing concerns of an economic slowdown in the US.</p>
<p>The US market is the largest market in the world and any significant moves on that market ripple out to other markets around the world. So the Australian market has turned down on the back of the US jitters, even though the sub-prime issue does not appear to be a major concern to Australian financial institutions.</p>
<h3>Markets in General</h3>
<p>The stock market can be a very emotional place to invest, which leads to over selling or over buying. A piece of news can be interpreted in many different ways, some investors may decide to ride this negativity through and so hold the share, others may decide that it is time to sell. What can happen is if enough parties want to sell the price of a share will go down, those that originally intended to hold their shares may then reassess that decision and so also sell, so forcing the price further down. This can then lead to the price of that particular share spiraling down to a price that is lower than what it is &ldquo;truly&rdquo; worth.</p>
<p>Over a large period of time these &ldquo;cycles&rdquo; become evident:</p>
<ul>
<li>October 1987 saw a significant loss on the Australian and world stock markets;</li>
<li>1999 saw a huge boom in markets on the back of the &ldquo;tech boom&rdquo;;</li>
<li>2002 and 2003 saw an unwinding of the tech boom;</li>
<li>The financial years ended 30 June 2004 through to 30 June 2007 saw very strong returns on the share markets;</li>
<li>We are now giving back some of these recent gains.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prime Super like the vast majority of superannuation funds invests in the local stock market, and international stock markets as well. So when these markets rise or fall so does the return on your superannuation investment.</p>
<h3>Things to Remember</h3>
<p>History shows that the stock markets rise and fall, sometimes dramatically. It is very important not to become emotional when investing. For example, those investors that stayed fully invested during the stock market crash of 1987 recovered all funds that were lost and benefited from the subsequent recovery, whilst those that sold out got none of the recovery.</p>
<p>Therefore you must remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Superannuation is a long term investment;</li>
<li>Volatility is something that is expected on the share market;</li>
<li>We have just had four consecutive years of very strong returns on the share markets;</li>
<li>History shows that markets tend to over estimate the real impact of information;</li>
<li>If you can wait out the downturn history shows that you will recover these losses in the long term;</li>
<li>In the long term markets recover, we just don&rsquo;t know how long that will take.</li>
</ul>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>To read recent newspapers reports and articles one would think that the financial sky is falling in. So should Prime Super members worry?</p>
<p>The answer quite simply is a resounding NO!</p>
<p>We have seen it all before, - the boom followed by the correction. <br />These market movements occur in cycles and, although the timing is not predictable, they are as regular as night follows day.</p>
<p>This particular correction has been anticipated for some time now and has been brought on by the so called &ldquo;sub-prime mortgage crisis&rdquo; in the US but if it hadn&rsquo;t been this that precipitated the flood of nervous investors dumping stock it would have been something else.</p>
<p>Why people panic and dump stock has been the subject of a number of studies but nobody really knows what prompts such a &ldquo;herd mentality&rdquo;. Some, such as those who have borrowed to purchase shares, may have good cause to dump them as the banks call up &ldquo;margin loans&rdquo; but this is not the case for your superannuation invested with Prime Super.</p>
<p>Historically the Australian Share Price has shown a steady upward movement for more than 100 years. (We draw your attention to the graph in the brochure &ldquo;Investments within Prime Super&rdquo; &ndash; under &ldquo;Forms and Publications&rdquo; above).</p>
<p>So what have we at Prime done to mitigate the situation for our members?</p>
<ul>
<li>Acting on the advice of Access Capital Advisors, one of the most respected investment consultants in Australia, we have invested in sound investments that will stand the test of time;</li>
<li>We have diversified our investment portfolio so that our &ldquo;eggs&rdquo; are in a variety of different &ldquo;baskets&rdquo; thus spreading the risk;</li>
<li>To protect our members from panic selling we have imposed a cooling off period on transfers between investments and on benefit payments (other than those resulting from death, disablement or financial hardship claims). The cooling off period will be from today until the unnecessary panic works its way out of the financial system. It will be reviewed regularly.</li>
</ul>
<p>IMPORTANTLY you should be mindful that any loss in your account balance is merely a &ldquo;paper loss&rdquo; until it is realised by a benefit payment or by a change in investments.</p>
<p>We urge members to sit tight and wait until the storm passes &ndash; History show that it undoubtedly will!</p>

            <summary><![CDATA[The Australian Stock market has enjoyed fantastic returns over the past three years and Prime Super’s investment team have ensured that our members have shared in this growth.]]></summary>
            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Stock market has enjoyed fantastic returns over the past three years and Prime Super&rsquo;s investment team have ensured that our members have shared in this growth.</p>
<p>As at 30 June 2007 the return on the average Balanced Option was 14.92% over one year and 14.15% over three years. The average Australian Equities Option was 26.3% over one year and 24.17% over three years.*</p>
<p>Since 30 June 2007, however, there have been significant fluctuations in the Australian Stock Market due, mainly, to the &ldquo;Sub-Prime&rdquo; crisis, causing market uncertainties in the U.S.</p>
<p>In light of this issue the benchmark ASX200 Index for the Australian market has moved as follows:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top">30 June 2007</td>
<td valign="top">6,274.93</td>
<td valign="top">&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">1 November 2007</td>
<td valign="top">6,828.7</td>
<td valign="top">Rise of 8.8% in&nbsp;four months.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">16 January 2008</td>
<td valign="top">5,809.7</td>
<td valign="top">Fall of 14.9% from its high&nbsp;two months earlier.&nbsp; This is a return for the current financial year of -7.4%.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>International shares are also suffering as a result of the U.S. situation, delivering a negative return year to date.</p>
<p>Recognising that Australian Equities make up between 25% and 40% of a Balanced Portfolio, with a further 15% to 35% being invested in International Equities, it is clear that performance returns within a Balanced Option are going to be effected.</p>
<p>The Balanced Option is specifically referred to here since it is the most common choice for Prime Super Fund members, but it must be remembered that all funds participating in Australian or International Equities will be affected to some degree. The less conservative the investment fund, the larger the effect will be. Listed below is the current asset allocation in Equities of Prime Funds.</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Asset Sector<br />(Target Allocation)</td>
<td valign="top">Capital Stable</td>
<td valign="top">Balanced</td>
<td valign="top">Managed</td>
<td valign="top">Australian<br />Equities</td>
<td valign="top">International<br />Equities</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">Australian Equities</td>
<td valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;9%</td>
<td valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp; 24%</td>
<td valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp; 30%</td>
<td valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp; 100%</td>
<td valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">International Equities</td>
<td valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.5%</td>
<td valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp; 24%</td>
<td valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp; 30%</td>
<td valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -</td>
<td valign="top">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The heady days of the past three years appear to have come to an end and expectations for the current year see the return for a Balanced Option being much lower than they have been in the past. This will be the case across the board for all superannuation offerings.</p>
<p>Although much can change between now and the end of the year, realistically, members should not expect a high return.</p>
<p>It is also very important that you do not forget that superannuation is a long term investment. Over the short term markets can swing significantly up and down, but the long term return is what is important, decisions on your long term investment strategy should not be based solely on short term fluctuations. If you are concerned about the impact of these recent fluctuations on your superannuation account balance you should get your own independent financial advice, or call our financial planning service on 1800 022 365.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Recent market fluctuations]]></title>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Over the past week or so we&rsquo;ve seen share markets around the world cop an absolute battering and Australia was not immune to the onslaught.</p>
<p>The main concern is the worsening sub-prime mortgage sector in the U.S. &ndash; these are mortgages given to people who don&rsquo;t qualify for standard loans because of their credit history or financial circumstances, and, as official interest rates started to rise those borrowers are finding they simply can&rsquo;t make their repayments.</p>
<p>Why is this impacting the market? Well, the sub-prime mortgage companies package up these loans and sell them as bonds to investors like fund managers and banks, who like them because the returns are higher than other bonds backed by standard mortgages. So when defaults start to occur, the ripple effect is huge.</p>
<p>Given this latest credit market meltdown, its little wonder investors are asking themselves whether they should sell up now and ask questions later, or hang on and hope the worst is over.</p>
<p>Central bankers and economic policy makers who gathered in Queensland at the APEC Finance Ministers Meeting were pretty much in agreement that the world economy is still strong and investors shouldn&rsquo;t be too concerned by this latest shake-out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So should I sell up or hang in there?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the million dollar question, but it is always best to be cautious about switching money into some other asset just because it may me performing better right now.</p>
<p>This also applies to switching between investment choices, if you pull out of an equity option and move to a cash option, you realise the stock market losses. It is also worth remembering that despite the recent falls, the Australian stock market and the world economy in general are still in pretty good shape. When you look at the broader picture, we&rsquo;re only back where we were in February this year, which is not too bad at all.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t panic &ndash; The worst may not be over but all the signs point to an eventual recovery. Remember, superannuation is a long-term investment!</p>]]></mainContent>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Investment markets delivered mixed results in March, reflecting mildly disappointing economic news in many markets. Of the major equity markets, Japan was the standout performer, driven by an unprecedented, government led policy to end deflation &ndash; a problem that central bankers have spent the better part of a decade trying to stamp out. The Nikkei equity index has responded by rising 19.3% over the March quarter, in local currency terms. Australian equity and emerging markets equities finished down for the month. Overseas fixed interest produced a positive return while Australian fixed interest was down slightly.</p>
<p>Economic news continued to disappoint in Europe and the Eurozone unemployment rate has hit a record high of 12%, the highest since a single currency was introduced in 1999. The significant variation in unemployment rates across countries highlights the vastly different economic performance within the Eurozone. Spain and Greece recorded unemployment rates above 26% while Germany has an unemployment rate of just 5.4%. France has experienced a significant downturn, with economic output falling at the fastest pace in four years. Economic output contractions also occurred in Spain and Italy. Germany was the only major economy to see an improvement in business activity, although the rate of expansion slowed considerably.</p>
<p>During the month, Cyprus, a European Union member country, dominated the headlines with a proposed controversial tax on bank depositors in order to shore up a number of banks in the country. This was the first time that retail bank depositors had been asked to accept losses, creating concerns that bank depositors in other European countries could also be penalised as part of any future bank bail-out package. While the final deal safeguarded smaller deposit holders (all deposits below &euro;100,000 were not subject to the tax), the tax seemed to open the door to further uncertainty in the region. Overall, however, equity and debt market performance in Europe has improved over the past 12 months since the European Central Bank pledged to unconditionally support European countries that needed short-term financial aid. Whether Cyprus is a symptom of this support beginning to waver or just a one-off is yet to be seen.</p>
<p>Economic data releases were generally mixed in the US over March, tempering the positive investor sentiment that has been evident throughout much of the first quarter. Manufacturing activity was weaker than expected during the month, and employment data disappointed, with the fewest jobs created since June 2012. The unemployment rate is currently 7.6%. Medium term, however, an improving housing sector and rising business confidence are underpinning a moderate recovery. The S&amp;P 500 equity index managed to surpass its record all-time closing high of 1565, driven by investor optimism that continues to be influenced by high corporate profits, which are a larger share of the US economy than ever before in history.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s economic growth in the first three months of 2013 slowed unexpectedly, reflecting weak industrial production. However, other economic indicators signalled an expansion of business activity over March, with both manufacturing and services activity increasing. On the other hand, inflation rose over February, and continues to be fed by rising wages.</p>
<p>Economic conditions in Australia remain mixed. The economy continues to grow at a below-trend rate. The Reserve Bank of Australia left the cash rate unchanged at 3.0% at its early April meeting, and has indicated that it remains open to further rate reductions in future, depending on economic conditions. While consumer confidence, retail sales and housing approvals were all positive and pointed to a healthy economic environment, housing credit and manufacturing conditions continue to remain sluggish. The Australian dollar increased by 2% against the US dollar over March, ending the month at US$1.04. Despite negative returns in March, the Australian equity market finished the quarter up 8.0%. Gains have been concentrated in defensive sectors such as healthcare and consumer staples, and high-dividend companies such as banks. Resource stocks, on the other hand, have underperformed the broader market significantly over the last 12 months.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Economic and Market Summary - February 2013]]></title>
            <summary><![CDATA[Risk assets rallied in February, following on from January’s strong gains. Rising investor sentiment has led to strong increases in most major equity markets during the first two months of 2013 reflecting improved expectations for profits and economi...]]></summary>
            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Risk assets rallied in February, following on from January&rsquo;s strong gains. Rising investor sentiment has led to strong increases in most major equity markets during the first two months of 2013 reflecting improved expectations for profits and economic conditions. The Australian market was the best performing equity market for February posting a strong positive gain of 4.6%. Fixed interest markets also produced positive returns over the month.</p>
<p>There were signs of improving economic conditions across the globe, although generally the economic outlook has not improved substantially despite the recent rallies in financial markets. In the US leading indicators were mixed, consumer confidence rebounded and there were continued signs of improvement in the housing sector.</p>
<p>Despite improving conditions in Germany, Europe&rsquo;s economic woes continue. A key issue facing the Eurozone is the political situation in Italy where general elections were held over the course of the month with no clear winner emerging. The political situation added to uncertainty in the region with investors anxious to see a stable government emerge. Significant structural economic reform programs are required to enhance the country&rsquo;s competitiveness and return it to a path of growth and the recent political machinations have led to little progress in this regard. There also exists a very real possibility that another general election will be called if no clear majority emerges which would further contribute to policy uncertainty in the region.</p>
<p>Positive sentiment towards Japanese equities led to strong gains over February. The equity market is heavily underpinned by the Bank of Japan&rsquo;s stated policy to lift inflation closer to its target 2% level. This is also having implications for the Japanese Yen which has depreciated significantly against most major currencies in recent months, which has in turn improved the prospects for Japanese exporters. Monetary policy conditions remain very loose by historical standards.</p>
<p>China continues to show signs of a moderate recovery with services and manufacturing activity expanding for the fourth consecutive month. The housing market continues to show signs of a robust recovery although policy makers will be paying close attention to official inflation measures to ensure the market does not overheat. In March the Chinese government outlined its GDP growth target of 7.5% for 2013, as well as a reduced inflation target of 3.5%. Fiscal spending will also be increased to provide a boost to domestic demand.</p>
<p>Australian economic data releases were generally mixed in February. The official cash rate remains unchanged at 3.0% with Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) adopting a wait and see approach before engaging in any further loosening of monetary policy. Manufacturing and services activity was softer over the first two months of 2013 while consumer confidence and business conditions showed signs of improvement. The Australian dollar was down slightly over the month, declining 2% against the US dollar to US$1.02.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Equity markets rallied strongly in January as a result of improved economic conditions across the globe and news of a partial resolution to the &lsquo;US fiscal cliff&rsquo; that had weighed on markets during 2012. Japan was the best performing equity market in local currency terms followed closely by the UK, US and Australian markets. Bonds posted mildly negative returns as yields rose across the board.</p>
<p>In Japan a change of government placed pressure on the Japanese central bank to &lsquo;pump prime&rsquo; the economy by creating easier monetary policy conditions to fight deflation and revive the flagging economy. The Japanese central bank will inject trillions of yen into the Japanese monetary system by further direct buying of government bonds and other assets. The bank has also doubled the official inflation target to 2%. This had the desired effect of depreciating the value of the currency to make Japanese exporters more competitive in the global market and the Japanese share market rallied accordingly.</p>
<p>In the US the announcement of a partial resolution to the fiscal cliff issues sparked the largest single one day rally in the S&amp;P 500 since December 2011. Economic releases were also better than expected in January with signs of improving conditions in the manufacturing sector as well as better than expected consumer sentiment readings and signs of a recovering housing sector. GDP growth surprised on the downside with a negative reading for Q4 2012 however this reflected a number of transitory factors and the one off impact of Hurricane Sandy which is estimated to have detracted approximately 0.5% from national GDP. A marked reduction in military spending also weighed down on the official GDP figures for Q4.</p>
<p>Economic conditions in Europe remain weak, although there have been some encouraging signs of improvement giving rise to hopes that Europe will emerge from recession in 2013. While manufacturing and services activity continue to disappoint there are signs of stabilisation across the board and there has also been an uptick in business conditions in Germany which is the region&rsquo;s largest economy. The largest concern has been the rapid deterioration in conditions in France which has seen rising unemployment and a deteriorating growth outlook which has kept investment plans and confidence subdued.</p>
<p>China appears to be on a stable path to economic recovery after a weak 2012 (the Chinese economy grew by its slowest annualised rate of growth in 2012 for almost 13 years). The Chinese manufacturing sector is beginning to show signs of robust expansion with survey participants reporting strengthened demand from clients in Europe and the US which is an encouraging sign for the world economy. One potential concern for China however is the rate of inflation (which came in higher than expected in December) which could reduce the prospect of a further easing in monetary policy conditions by policymakers.</p>
<p>There were signs of further weakness in the Australian economy over January despite an improvement in the iron ore price (which rallied strongly in Q4 2012) Housing finance edged lower and employment conditions remain subdued. Business conditions remain weak although there was a slight improvement in business confidence reported in January. A key development was the announcement of the election which is to be held on September 14. There have been suggestions that the political landscape in Australia has been weighing down on consumer and business confidence and having a negative effect on investment plans and spending in the economy. While the announcement of an election date has removed some uncertainty, the prolonged campaign may result in a postponement of some spending decisions until after the election.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Listed equity markets were positive overall in December. Of the major markets, the Japanese Nikkei delivered the strongest returns. The Australian share market delivered a strong gain, while the US stock market underperformed after bouts of volatility during the month caused by concerns that lawmakers would not reach a deal in time to avoid the approaching fiscal cliff. Emerging markets rallied strongly amid signs of an improvement in economic conditions. Fixed interest markets were relatively flat both in Australia and overseas.</p>
<p>In the US, political negotiations to avoid the &lsquo;fiscal cliff&rsquo; were the key theme over December. The fiscal cliff refers to a suite of tax increases and spending cuts designed to reduce the US government deficit, which would have come into effect automatically at the start of 2013. An agreement was reached which solved some near term issues, but did not provide longer term solutions to all of the issues.</p>
<p>Uncertainty surrounding the issue is likely to continue to impact business confidence and constrain investment plans in the US. Large scale spending cuts would again raise the risk of recession, while a growing government deficit increases the likelihood of sovereign downgrades and harder readjustments in future years. Not surprisingly, business and consumer confidence remains low, despite evidence that the wider economy has been growing better than expected. Despite the negativity of both business and consumers, and the impact of hurricane Sandy (which struck the east coast of the US as a tropical storm front on 29 October), there has been general improvement in employment, industrial production, and housing over the last six months.</p>
<p>In Europe, the intensity of the Sovereign Crisis has lessened for the time being. While significant issues remain, the likelihood of a major negative event has been reduced given the recent measures adopted by the IMF and the ECB. As such European equity markets have rallied over the year to finish 2012 with strong gains. The economic environment however did continue to deteriorate in December with a number of economic indicators released over the month pointing to a shallow recession. Industrial production in Germany came in lower than expectations, and France also experienced a sharp drop in industrial activity. On a more positive note, business expectations for German industry and trade rose in December which indicated that businesses are less pessimistic about future developments in the Euro zone&rsquo;s largest economy. This was the sharpest increase since August 2009. There were also some encouraging signs of improving economic conditions in periphery countries which is a positive signal.</p>
<p>In China, there were signs of improving economic conditions over December. Manufacturing activity continued to show signs of mild expansion for the second consecutive month, with purchasing activity rising at its fastest pace in almost two years. Infrastructure activity, which is a key driver of growth, has been accelerating since Q2 2012, and the Chinese property market is also showing signs of recovery. The Chinese government is currently providing very supportive fiscal and monetary policy conditions which are contributing to the recovery in economic activity.</p>
<p>In Australia, economic data continued to disappoint. House price data and information on manufacturing and services activity continued to show that the recent interest rate cuts by the RBA had failed to improve demand conditions in the domestic economy. On the export front the recovery in the iron ore price to US $150/tonne has been very good for miners and the broader Australian economy. However domestic economic conditions continue to remain soft with both consumer sentiment and business sentiment falling in December. The Australian dollar ended the month flat at US$1.04.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Listed equity markets were positive overall in November, delivering modest gains. While there was an initial sell off early in the month following the US presidential election, share markets subsequently regained their losses following the announcement of a further aid package for Greece and signs of improving economic activity in emerging market economies (particularly China). Of the major markets, the Japanese Nikkei delivered the strongest returns, increasing by 6% in local currency terms. The Australian share market underperformed, while the US stock market also delivered subdued returns.&nbsp; Fixed interest markets were relatively flat in Australia but posted positive returns overseas.</p>
<p>In the US, economic data showed signs of improvement, with GDP growth for the third quarter of 2012 revised upwards to an annualised rate of 2.7%, a strong increase from the previous quarter. The positive result reflects improving domestic demand and a recovering housing sector. The unemployment rate also fell by more than expected to 7.7%. However, much of this was driven by a fall in the participation rate, as discouraged job seekers dropped out of the workforce. Following the US presidential election, attention turned to the &lsquo;fiscal cliff&rsquo;, that is, the suite of automatic tax increases and spending cuts which will take effect early next year and which have the potential to tip the economy into recession. Business sentiment continues to be impacted by the ongoing uncertainty in relation to this issue, and manufacturing activity was below expectations in November.</p>
<p>In Europe, economic indicators have continued to disappoint, although there are signs that conditions may be stabilising, with production and employment appearing to have bottomed.&nbsp; That said, business confidence remains fragile in light of the region&rsquo;s debt crisis, and the economy is prone to further set backs should the crisis worsen. &lsquo;Core&rsquo; European economies such as Germany and France have been affected by weak conditions in the rest of the Eurozone. November saw a sharp fall in services activity in Germany, while the downturn in manufacturing eased to some degree. France continues to experience recessionary conditions, with manufacturing shrinking for the ninth straight month.</p>
<p>While the European sovereign debt crisis continues to be a major concern for business and investors, the announcement of an additional assistance package for Greece was interpreted as a major positive step, driving an equity market rally. The package included a reduction in interest rates on existing loans, an extension of maturities on certain debt and an extended horizon for Greece to meet its budgetary goals. There was also a veiled acknowledgement that debt forgiveness of some outstanding loans may eventually be necessary to put Greece back on a sustainable financial path.</p>
<p>Chinese economic activity continues to be weak but has shown signs of recovery.&nbsp; Manufacturing activity improved over November, indicative of expansion for the first time since October 2011. The leadership transition in November has removed some political uncertainty, and economic data suggests that the risk of a &lsquo;hard landing&rsquo; for the Chinese economy has been alleviated. The Chinese residential property market continues to show signs of recovery, with healthy property sales and rising home prices in major Chinese cities. This is broadly supportive of resources, and base metals prices also posted strong gains due to speculation that China&rsquo;s new leadership group will encourage higher levels of consumption following a pledge to boost urbanisation.</p>
<p>In Australia, economic data continues to be mixed. Retail sales data was disappointing, suggesting that previous interest rate cuts have failed to gain traction with consumers. Key concerns for the Australian economy include the peak in mining investment and weakness in other areas of the economy outside of the mining sector. The RBA reduced interest rates by 0.25% at its early November, as was widely expected by markets. This brings the official cash rate to 3%, which is exceptionally low by historical standards. The Australian dollar ended the month flat at US$1.04.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Financial markets were generally positive over October following the September announcements of further central bank easing which led to strong rallies in risk assets. Markets began to focus on fundamentals and in particular Q3 US earnings which contained a number of negative surprises. The Australian share market produced a positive return of 2.9% while the MSCI World Index fell by 0.5%. The US was the worst performing country with negative earnings outcomes and guidance resulting in markets finishing lower by month end. Bond markets finished relatively flat, with yields broadly unchanged.</p>
<p>European economic data continued to disappoint in October, with most indicators suggesting that the region is in recession. Europe wide manufacturing and services activity continues to contract as austerity measures weigh on domestic demand. Even Germany has begun to show signs of contraction and poor sentiment. The one bright spot for Europe has been the United Kingdom. Boosted by the Olympics in August and September, GDP in the UK grew by 1.0% for the September quarter. However, data released in October and early November does not suggest a strong recovery as manufacturing remains weak. For the time being, the European Central Bank&rsquo;s bond buying operation has prevented the ongoing sovereign crisis from escalating however many peripheral European countries are showing signs of stress as &lsquo;austerity&rsquo; measures create persistently high unemployment and in some cases, social unrest. In Greece a further bailout was negotiated with EU finance ministers as was the 2013 government budget. Greece remains in a very fragile state and EU ministers are currently negotiating another aid and debt relief package designed to support the troubled economy.</p>
<p>Hurricane Sandy and corporate earnings releases were a key focus in the US in October.&nbsp; Late in the month Hurricane Sandy also shut down most of the US east coast. Economic data releases were mixed with a number of negative surprises however, GDP growth, manufacturing and retail sales were all in positive territory. GDP figures showed that the US economy was growing faster than expectations with an annualised rate of growth of 2% for Q3. This was offset to some degree by a fall in exports and weaker business spending.&nbsp; The impact of Hurricane Sandy is expected to have a modest negative effect on economic growth in October but will create a slight increase in economic activity in November and December as reconstruction and recovery commence. Manufacturing activity expanded and non-manufacturing areas such as agriculture, tourism and retailing also grew over the month.&nbsp; On the employment front, unemployment remained fixed at 7.9%, and other data releases were mixed. A key headwind facing the US economy is the &ldquo;fiscal cliff&rsquo;, which describes a range of tax increases and spending cuts that will occur in 2013 in the absence of political intervention.&nbsp; Should a solution not present itself, then the economy will likely enter a recession in 2013.</p>
<p>News in China has been dominated by the announcement of the new Standing Committee who will drive the economic and political reform agenda. The lead up to the leadership transition has been marked by political issues; the most publicised was the expulsion of a senior party member who had been a contender for one of the senior leadership roles. Despite this the transition proceeded as anticipated, with most commentators expecting there to be little impact on economic or social policies in the near term. From an economic perspective China continued to deliver positive results with inflation remaining low and production higher. The data suggests that the slowdown in manufacturing has bottomed and there will be a modest recovery in the months ahead.</p>
<p>Data from the Australian economy was broadly positive as the RBA elected to keep interest rates on hold at 3.25% in early November after cutting by 0.25% at its October meeting. Better retail sales and building approvals were cited as positive effects resulting from previous interest rate cuts. Unemployment remained at 5.4% after rising from 5.1% in September, however there remains evidence of weakness in the Australia labour markets as the participation rate declined further and average hours worked also continued to fall. The high level of the Australian dollar continues to hurt the economy (ending the month relatively flat at US $1.04). Rising production costs and falling commodity prices are also putting pressure on the Australian resources sector with more news of mine closures and projects being put on hold. On a positive note consumers were buoyed by recent interest rate cuts and an increased number were deemed to agree that now was a &lsquo;good time to buy a dwelling&rsquo;.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>September was a good month for equities with most major world markets finishing higher for the fourth successive month in a row. The key theme was central bank intervention in Europe, the US and Japan which resulted in strong gains across most individual country share markets. The MSCI world index increased by 2.1% over the month and emerging markets were a particularly strong performer. Both overseas and Australian fixed income markets posted modest positive returns while the Australian dollar ended the month flat.</p>
<p>In Europe, the European Central Bank announced its plans to assist stressed sovereigns in September. The program allows for unlimited bond buying at maturities of up to three years once a sovereign has formally sought assistance. The unlimited buying reduces the potential for any sovereign to default on its debt as not only does it lower interest costs, but also provides a willing buyer of last resort to rollover any debt. The announcement of the program prompted a rebound in investor sentiment. The majority of leading indicators of economic activity and fundamental economic data remain subdued in Europe. Consumer confidence remains low, and manufacturing indicators also suggest an economy that continues to struggle. The last time consumer confidence was this low prior to the financial crisis was in the recession of the early 1990s.</p>
<p>In September the US Federal Reserve announced that it would be extending its quantitative easing program and introducing further liquidity into the monetary system. The intention of the program is to stimulate economic growth by lowering borrowing rates across the economy. The additional easing is open ended in nature, which was a key positive for the markets. It involves buying unlimited quantities of agency mortgage backed securities for an indefinite period of time or until the central bank begins to see signs of improving employment growth. Overall economic data in the US remains subdued although there was some positive surprises over the month. The closely watched ISM manufacturing survey recovered modestly in September, and the official unemployment rate fell to 7.8%, which created some cause for optimism. Labour market conditions were genuinely mixed with the lower overall unemployment rate being offset by a falling participation rate fell and an increase in part time employment.</p>
<p>In China economy activity remains weak, however the slowdown appears to be moderating. Manufacturing indicators improved marginally, however still remain below a level that would indicate an expanding manufacturing sector. Iron ore, which is one of Australia&rsquo;s primary exports, has seen an uptick in volumes over the month however the overall value of those imports has been affected by falling prices, worsening Australia&rsquo;s terms of trade with China. One positive sign from an Australian export perspective is the Chinese residential property market which appears to be showing some signs of growth.</p>
<p>In Australia the Reserve Bank cut interest rates by 0.25% at its 2 October meeting to bring the benchmark overnight interest rate to 3.25%, its lowest level since October 2009. The RBA cited weaker global growth, particularly the sharper than expected slowdown in China, as well as the persistently high exchange rate as reasons for the rate cut. The RBA expects the investment component of economic growth to dip over the next 12 months and has been easing monetary conditions to stimulate other components of the economy. In general terms Australian economic indicators were weak over September. The Australian trade balanced deteriorated due to a fall in net exports driven by recent falls in iron ore and coal prices. Retail spending was subdued, growing by only 0.2% in August, while unemployment remains at historically low levels. Overall labour market conditions have not been improving given the average hours per worker has reduced and the participation rate has also been in decline. There has also been a sustained pickup in the amount of unemployment benefits paid since mid-2011.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Global equity markets posted positive gains in August which was the third successive month of positive returns. Markets were driven by developments in Europe and in particular growing expectations of large scale intervention from the European Central Bank. The expectation is that the ECB will take significant steps to ease the debt burden of troubled European sovereigns. This contributed to European equity markets posting the best results of the major world equity markets. The MSCI World index appreciated by 1.8% (in local currency terms) over the course of the month. In fixed income markets both Australian and overseas bonds delivered modest positive gains.</p>
<p>Comments made by ECB President Mario Draghi in late July were a key focus for market participants. Draghi asserted that the ECB would be &lsquo;strongly supportive&rsquo; of intervention to help preserve the Euro and this boosted confidence in the region. Expectations were that significant policy initiatives would be announced by the ECB that would help support indebted European economies. In early September the ECB announced that it would be buying the government debt of European sovereign lenders that applied for assistance. The aim of the program is to lower the financing costs of countries experiencing financial difficulties by keeping government bond yields at manageable levels. The announcement generated positive sentiment, particularly in European markets, but also in other major equity markets across the globe. Whilst the finer details of the program are yet to be announced and the program is still to receive formal approval, concerns remain over the general level of competitiveness of many European economies (particularly those with heavy debt burdens).</p>
<p>In the US the focus was on the release of a number of key economic indicators. The majority of indicators pointed to an economy that continues to grow at a slow pace. The general picture is disappointing particularly given the large levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus that have been injected into the economy by US policymakers There was a slump in corporate earnings, manufacturing data was generally weak, and surveys of business confidence indicate that US businesses remain cautious. The unemployment rate fell marginally to 8.1%, which would normally be interpreted as a positive for the economy, however the drop was driven by a fall in the participation rate. Given the poor overall outlook, expectations remain that there will be further rounds of stimulus to help boost economic activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In China there was evidence of an economy that continues to slow. Key manufacturing surveys were released over the month which pointed to a decelerating rate of growth (albeit it at moderating pace). Fixed asset investment growth remains low compared with previous years however it has stabilised at current levels. This indicator is of particular interest for the Australian economy as it reflects demand for iron ore and coking coal which are two of Australia&rsquo;s largest export commodities.</p>
<p>Government bond yields in Australia and overseas were largely unchanged over the month while the Australian dollar fell relative to the US dollar, finishing down 1.7%. In terms of economic activity in Australia the unemployment rate remains at historically low levels however there are concerns over a declining participation rate and the changing structure of the employment landscape with growing numbers of people in part time work relative to full time employment. Economic indicators were varied in August. Retail sales disappointed on the downside while recent delays and cancellations in some high profile mining projects also pointed to a slow rate of economic growth. Australian companies continue to hoard cash and are reluctant to invest in new projects given concerns over global financial conditions (particularly in China). Declines in key commodities prices (iron ore and coal) are also of concern.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Economic and Market Summary - July 2012]]></title>
            <summary><![CDATA[Financial markets continue to remain focussed on Europe, and the Eurozone’s sovereign debt issues. In July, market sentiment was positive overall, driven partly by comments from the European Central Bank (ECB) President, Mario Draghi, which led to ho...]]></summary>
            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Financial markets continue to remain focussed on Europe, and the Eurozone&rsquo;s sovereign debt issues. In July, market sentiment was positive overall, driven partly by comments from the European Central Bank (ECB) President, Mario Draghi, which led to hopes that the ECB would intervene in bond markets to keep government interest rates lower. This helped to drive equity markets higher, with the MSCI World index increasing 1.3% in local currency terms. Most major markets were up over the month, with the exception of the Japanese Nikkei which declined. The Australian dollar appreciated over July, which offset much of the gains on overseas assets (where unhedged). Overseas fixed interest delivered positive returns, as government bond yields declined further, ending the month close to record lows.</p>
<p>European economic data continued to disappoint in July, with most indicators suggesting that the region is contracting slightly. European manufacturers have seen new orders decline rapidly and confidence in the services sector is the lowest it has been since early 2009. Economic weakness has also begun to affect financially strong countries such as Germany. Germany&rsquo;s manufacturing industry has cooled significantly and is now at a level consistent with a recession. Similarly, the UK manufacturing sector is contracting significantly.</p>
<p>Over the course of July, Spanish and Italian government bond yields increased significantly, both reaching fresh all time (post Euro) highs. Crucially, Spanish government bond yields moved through the 7% threshold, the level at which other nations have sought external assistance. It was against this backdrop of disappointing data, that ECB President, Mario Draghi, made strong public comments in support of the Euro in a speech on 26 July. He pledged that the ECB was willing to do &ldquo;whatever it takes&rdquo; to preserve the Eurozone from collapse.&nbsp; Equity markets gained and bond yields tightened following these comments, which many interpreted as a sign that the ECB may recommence purchasing government bonds. However, markets were subsequently disappointed when this commitment was watered down in a later announcement in early August.</p>
<p>While the slowdown in growth has been global, most indicators suggest that the US economy is continuing to experience patchy growth. US manufacturers continue to struggle, with new orders falling and inventories increasing.&nbsp; Markets remain concerned about the &lsquo;fiscal cliff&rsquo; of US$1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts and tax increases scheduled to begin in January 2013. While most expect that legislators will act to avoid these cuts, this could potentially be a significant drag on the US economy. On the positive side, labour market data was better than market expectations, with 163,000 new jobs created in July. However, the increase in jobs was not enough to offset growth of the workforce, and as a result, the unemployment rate increased slightly to 8.3%. Due to the weak data, markets are considering further stimulus from the US central bank is increasingly likely, and this possibility has boosted market sentiment.</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s economic growth has slowed, although there are signs that growth is stabilising at current levels.&nbsp; Fixed asset investment growth has declined over the last year, and remains low compared to levels experienced over the last three years. Industrial production and retail sales growth have also moderated.&nbsp; The Chinese government, which had previously been tightening, has responded with both fiscal and monetary stimulus. The focus has turned to whether the announced stimulus will be sufficient to boost the economy, and concerns remain about a worse than expected economic slowdown.</p>
<p>Data from the Australian economy continues to be mixed. On a positive note, Australian retail volumes grew strongly over the March and June quarters.&nbsp; Terms of trade data for the June quarter was also stronger than expected, primarily driven by exports which were more resilient than expected. On the negative side, the manufacturing sector continues to struggle.&nbsp; The future outlook for commodities has weakened, which is a key concern for the Australian economy. Prices of key commodities have fallen significantly to date; however, export volumes have remained high. The Australian dollar remains at a high level, partly due to strong demand for Australian assets (in particular Commonwealth and State government bonds), reflecting the relatively high yield for a developed economy. The Australian dollar increased by 2.6% against the US dollar in July.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Most major share markets were up significantly in June, helping to reverse some of the previous month&rsquo;s losses. Investors remain focussed on the situation in Europe, and markets reacted positively to events in June which reduced near term risks to the Euro zone. Over the course of the month, the MSCI World index increased 4.1% in local currency terms.</p>
<p>However, some of these gains were offset by the increase in the Australian dollar over the month (for unhedged Australian investors). The Australian share market was not as strong as its overseas counterparts, delivering a modest positive return. Fixed interest returns were flat over the month, as bond yields were mostly unchanged.</p>
<p>US economic releases in June were disappointing.&nbsp; US employment figures have halted their previous positive trend. In June, fewer jobs were added than expected, while the unemployment rate remained steady at 8.2%. The reduction in government employment has been a particular drag on employment over the last year, in particular due to budget cuts at the state level. The manufacturing sector has also continued to struggle, reflecting a decline in foreign demand as the global economic slowdown impacts US exports. The closely watched ISM survey showing that manufacturing levels unexpectedly contracted in June, with the lowest reading since 2009. Raw material prices have also declined sharply reflecting lower global demand. On the positive side, falling energy and commodity prices could benefit consumer sectors, as they flow through to lower prices for finished goods.</p>
<p>In Europe, investors remain focussed on the sovereign debt crisis; however, events in June helped to reassure investors. Markets were relieved by the outcome of the June Greek national elections. The pro Euro New Democracy party defeated the anti austerity far left and far right parties, thus reducing the immediate risk of Greece leaving the Euro zone. In late June, following negations at the European Union summit, European leaders agreed to the creation of a joint banking supervisory body for the Eurozone and a series of measures to directly support struggling banks. These measures, which involve steps towards further integration of the European financial system, provided meaningful relief to markets in a short term context. That said, the underlying issue of government solvency remains unresolved for several European countries. The economic outlook for Europe has also continued to deteriorate, with many large European countries now back in recession. European economies are feeling the impact of austerity measures and poor confidence.</p>
<p>With major export markets weakening and domestic construction activity slowing, China&rsquo;s economic activity has continued to decelerate in recent months. China&rsquo;s manufacturing indices fell in June, indicating further slowing of this important sector. Of most concern was the continuing sharp decline in new orders which could be indicative of further weakness in the months ahead. The Chinese government has responded with both fiscal and monetary stimulus; however concerns remain about a more meaningful than expected economic slow-down.</p>
<p>The performance of the Australian economy remains mixed, with a growing divergence between mining and non mining sectors. June employment numbers were below expectations, with the loss of jobs resulting in a slight increase in the unemployment rate to 5.2%.The biggest job losses have been in construction, reflecting the substantial decline in construction activity, particularly apartment building.&nbsp; Declining commodity prices and the global economic slowdown have impacted the Australian economy. However, despite these international headwinds, the Australian economy is expected to grow by more than 3% in 2012 and 3.5% in 2013, a strong outcome compared to most developed countries. This is driven in part by substantial mining investment, in particular, Liquid Natural Gas export capacity in Western Australia and Queensland. The Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates by 0.25% in June, taking the cash rate to 3.5%. The Australian dollar increased by 5% against the US dollar, to end the month at US$1.02.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>May proved to be a challenging month for investors, as worries about European sovereign debt issues and weak economic data from the US and China weighed on markets. Most countries&rsquo; share markets declined substantially, and the MSCI World Index was down 7.1% in local currency terms over the month. Defensive asset classes outperformed, as investors sought safe haven assets. Australian fixed interest performed particularly well due to a meaningful fall in Australian Government bond yields, reflecting weak Australian economic data and a larger than expected interest rate cut. The Australian dollar declined steadily over May, which helped to shield Australian investors from some of the equity market declines in unhedged Australian dollar terms.</p>
<p>Financial markets continue to be focussed on Europe and the region&rsquo;s ongoing sovereign and banking crisis.&nbsp; Growth prospects for Europe have deteriorated, and the unemployment rate has increased meaningfully over the last year. Poor economic performance is now widespread, with steep downturns evident in Spain, Italy and France, while the German economy is also contracting marginally. Political turmoil in Greece weighed on markets during May, as investors considered the likelihood that Greece would choose to exit the Eurozone, and contemplated the implications of a Greek exit for the broader European economy and banking system. Spain is also a focal point for markets due to its weak economy and troubled banks. The Spanish government requested a bailout to support its banking system in early June. European leaders have since announced a number of positive policy measures which aim to provide further support to financial institutions and reduce the pressure on governments. While these were positive steps, the underlying issues of government solvency and poor competiveness remain unresolved.</p>
<p>The ongoing uncertainty and global economic slowdown resulting from the European sovereign debt crisis have impacted growth in the US. Economic data releases over the last few months have generally fallen short of expectations. May labour market data was disappointing, with weak jobs growth resulting in a slight increase in the unemployment rate from 8.1% to 8.2%. Consumer and business confidence levels have also shown little signs of improvement, and are currently at levels typically associated with recession. That said, overall the US economy has so far proved relatively resistant, and continues to experience modest growth. The US housing market has shown signs of improvement, albeit from a very low base. The increase in new housing starts, if continued, would be a positive for the construction industry and US economy.</p>
<p>The global economic slowdown has impacted Chinese exporters which remain an important part of the Chinese economy. The official Chinese manufacturing index for May disappointed markets, with larger falls than expected. Economic data continues to be patchy, and there has been considerably uncertainty surrounding the extent of the economic slowdown that China is currently experiencing. That said, stimulus measures introduced by Chinese authorities should help to reduce the impact of the global slowdown on the Chinese economy. Stimulus measures have included interest rate cuts and a push to streamline funding for infrastructure projects. Inflation has also fallen significantly, giving policymakers room for further stimulus measures if needed to support growth.</p>
<p>Australian economic data has been mixed, with some releases very poor, while others have surprised on the upside. Australia&rsquo;s March quarter GDP figures materially exceeded market expectations, with growth of 1.3% for the quarter and 4.3% year on year. Strong household consumption was a key driver of the strong outcome, which surprised markets given the current levels of consumer caution. On the other hand, businesses which have not benefitted directly from the mining boom are continuing to struggle due to relatively high interest rates and the high Australian dollar. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut interest rates by a larger than expected 0.5% in early May, taking the cash rate to 3.75%. This decision was based on concerns about the outlook for the global economy and lower than expected inflation data released in late April. The RBA&rsquo;s rate cut and increasing risk aversion saw the Australian dollar decline steadily over May to end the month at US$0.97.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Most equity markets underperformed in April, driven by renewed European sovereign debt concerns and weaker than expected economic data. The developed overseas equity index returned minus 1.7% in unhedged Australian dollar terms. The Australian share market performed relatively well and was one of the only major markets to deliver positive returns over the month. That said, Australian equities have underperformed significantly relative to other markets over the past year. Fixed interest performed well, as bond yields tightened as a result of the deteriorating outlook.&nbsp; Over the last year both Australian and overseas fixed interest have delivered strong returns.</p>
<p>Markets continue to remain focussed on the European sovereign debt crisis. The crisis has weighed on business and consumer confidence, and has resulted in a high level of stress in the European financial system.&nbsp; Measures announced by European leaders and the European Central Bank have helped support the stability of the financial system to date. That said, the underlying issues of unsustainably high government debt and poor competitiveness in some economies remain. As a result, the economic outlook for Europe remains poor, with many suggesting that Europe as a whole is already in a recession. The harsh austerity measures being forced upon many countries in exchange for bailout funds have had a significant impact on their economies, resulting in falling GDP and rising unemployment. In both Spain and Greece, unemployment rates have increased significantly over the last 12 months and are currently over 20%.&nbsp; Recent elections in France and Greece have added to the uncertainty, as they signalled increasing opposition to austerity measures and resulted in leadership changes. Markets continue to watch France in particular, as the new president Francois Hollande has previously signalled his opposition to austerity measures. As the second largest economy in the Euro zone, France remains crucial to any plans to stabilise the Euro.</p>
<p>The ongoing uncertainty and global economic slowdown resulting from the European sovereign debt crisis have impacted growth in the US. However, overall the US economy has proved relatively resilient, and most economic indicators remain consistent with an economy that is experiencing moderate positive growth. Following a period of stronger than expected results, recent US economic data releases have been mixed. The closely watched US ISM economic indicators showed strength in manufacturing, while the services index fell sharply. Labour market data softened, however, job creation continues and the unemployment rate decreased marginally from 8.2% to 8.1%. US retail sales continue to be robust, however, much of this has been driven by a decrease in the savings rate rather than growth in real wages. The US economy continues to face longer term headwinds to due to the government&rsquo;s large fiscal deficits and high debt levels. Over the long term, the fiscal consolidation (through increased taxes or lower government spending) that is required to balance the budget will be likely to impact growth.</p>
<p>The Chinese economy has also experienced a slowdown as a result of the contraction in the European economy combined with a weak domestic property market. Export growth has been impacted by weak demand from Europe, which remains China&rsquo;s largest market.&nbsp; Manufacturing activity has weakened, although this has stabilised more recently. On the positive side, Chinese fixed investment growth increased in March as a number of infrastructure projects resumed. China also recorded a better than expected surplus in April.&nbsp; Overall, economic data suggests that growth is stabilising at modest levels.</p>
<p>The outlook for the Australian economy remains positive relative to most of the developed world, however, many sectors of the economy have struggled with relatively high interest rates, a high Australian dollar and a cautious consumer. Consumer and business confidence remain weak, and this has impacted a wide range of sectors such as retail. Australia&rsquo;s trade balance deteriorated during the March quarter, reflecting disappointing exports, driven by falling commodity prices. The manufacturing industry continued to show significant weakness, and housing approvals have also been weak for some time.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) surprised markets by cutting interest rates by 0.50% in early May, following cuts of 0.25% in each of November and December. Financial markets continue to expect the RBA to reduce interest rates further over the next 12 months, which should provide some relief to the economy. The Australian dollar increased marginally over the month, up 0.8% against the US dollar.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Equity markets have performed well since the start of the year, and continued to deliver positive returns in March. Developed overseas equities delivered the strongest performance, in part due to the falling Australian dollar which increased the unhedged return earned by Australian investors. Performance for individual country share markets was mixed over the month. The Japanese Nikkei and the US S&amp;P 500 both performed well, while the UK FTSE and the emerging markets equity index were the poorest performers.</p>
<p>Concerns about the level of government debt in a number of European countries have weighed on business and consumer confidence, and economic indicators continue to point to the likelihood that Europe is already in a recession. The European Central Bank&rsquo;s Long Term Refinancing Operations have helped to support the stability of the European financial system, at least in the short term, and this has boosted the performance of equity markets over the last few months. The restructuring of Greek debt for private bond holders has provided a template for future sovereign restructurings are likely to be required.&nbsp; Attention has quickly moved to Spain, partly due to its large size, being the fourth largest economy in the Eurozone. Spain has struggled with high unemployment since its property bubble burst in 2008 and has had difficulty financing its government debt, despite implementing budget cuts. During the month, European governments announced moves to increase the size of the bailout funds.&nbsp; While this is a positive development, it is likely that there will be further problems within the region that will unsettle markets going forward.</p>
<p>In the US, recent data releases continue to be consistent with an economy which is experiencing positive growth. Over the last few months, US economic data has surprised on the upside, and this has driven the strong performance of the US equity market relative to other markets.&nbsp; Retail sales have been robust, in line with the improving economic outlook. However, a number of recent economic releases failed to meet consensus expectations.&nbsp; Many confidence measures have paused in March, and the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) small business survey recorded a small decline during the month.&nbsp; March labour market data was also disappointing, with the fewest jobs created in five months and lower than markets were expecting.</p>
<p>There has been considerable uncertainty surrounding the extent of the economic slowdown in China, which continued to attract a lot of attention from markets. Economic data in March provided a mixed picture. Official manufacturing numbers for March were stronger than expected, however, HSBC&rsquo;s measure of manufacturing activity (which has more small business respondents and picks up greater seasonality) continued to fall. China&rsquo;s large export sector has felt the impact of contracting European growth and the slowing property market provides a highly uncertain backdrop.&nbsp; During the month, BHP announced that it was expecting lower (but still robust) iron ore demand from China, which unsettled commodity markets.</p>
<p>China remains crucial for the outlook for the Australian economy, reflecting the close economic linkages due to Australia&rsquo;s commodity exports. Australia posted back to back trade deficits in January and February as the high Australian dollar and lower prices of commodities impacted the local economy. Credit growth has been subdued as consumers and businesses reduce their debt levels following a large credit boom. Manufacturing activity has also been weak due to softer demand, the strong Australian dollar, the impending carbon tax and strong overseas competition.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) left rates unchanged at its April meeting, however, the wording of the RBA statement paved the way for a rate cut in May, as long the inflation outcomes are not uncomfortably high. Both Australian and overseas fixed interest delivered modest positive returns during the month, and have performed well over the last year. The Australian dollar declined during March, decreasing by 4% against the US dollar to end the month at US$1.04.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Equities continued their strong performance in February, as markets responded to better than expected economic data in the US and measures taken by the European Central Bank which helped to reduce the likelihood of a banking crisis. Emerging markets equity was the best performing asset class, returning 4.3% in Australian dollar terms over the month.&nbsp; Developed markets overseas equity also performed well, returning 3.2% in February in Australian dollar terms. Australian equities lagged relative to overseas markets, but still delivered positive performance.&nbsp; Fixed interest generated subdued performance during the month, although it still remains the strongest performing asset class over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Improving economic data out of the US has helped to drive strong equity market performance, and US equities have performed well relative to other share markets over the last 12 months.&nbsp; Overall, economic indicators continue to be consistent with positive, but modest, growth. In February, the closely watched ISM economic indicators suggested stronger growth outcomes in the services sector, although growth in the manufacturing sector surprised on the downside. The US labour market has shown significant signs of improvement over the last few months, with the unemployment rate decreasing from 9.1% in August 2011 to 8.3% in February. Consumer and business confidence also improved during the month, although these remain at low levels.&nbsp; While recent economic data has been better than expected, the US economy faces the longer term challenge of high government deficits and debt levels.&nbsp; The possibility of higher oil prices also remains a significant risk for the US economy.</p>
<p>The economic outlook in Europe remains poor, with most indicators pointing to the likelihood that Europe as a whole is currently in a recession. Sovereign debt concerns continue to dominate, and these have impacted consumer and business confidence. Conditions are particularly poor in countries with high deficits and debts such as Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Spain.&nbsp; These countries continue to struggle with contracting economies and high unemployment. The European Central Bank has acted to provide support to the European banking system, helping to avert a severe credit crisis. However, despite these measures, banks have continued to reduce credit availability for households and corporates, which has further impacted economic growth.</p>
<p>A widely anticipated restructuring of Greece&rsquo;s government debt occurred in early March, the largest sovereign debt restructuring in history. Private investors agreed to accept significant losses on their holdings of Greek government bonds, helping to reduce Greece&rsquo;s government debt burden. This was classified as an official debt default, triggering credit default swaps (which are essentially insurance against such an event). The successful restructuring helped to allay market fears of a disorderly Greek default, or breakup of the Euro.&nbsp; However, ongoing concerns remain, as Greece&rsquo;s government debt levels are expected to remain very high even after the restructuring.</p>
<p>Slowing global demand, led by the major developed economies, has also impacted the outlook for emerging market economies. Economic indicators suggest that growth in China has slowed, although it still remains relatively high. Consistent with the expectation of lower growth in the future, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao recently announced that the 2012 GDP growth target would be 7.5%, down from 8%. Emerging market economies had been impacted by tight monetary policy (higher interest rates) introduced last year to combat inflationary pressures. However, inflation has begun to decline in the emerging world, led by declining food prices. As a result, many emerging economies have a greater ability to reduce interest rates if required to support their economies, and some have already commenced this process.</p>
<p>While the outlook for the Australian economy is relatively favourable overall, growth has been affected by slower global demand, particularly from emerging market economies. Economic indicators remain mixed, and some sectors, such as retail, have continued to be impacted by the high Australian dollar and consumer caution. Credit growth has remained subdued, reflecting weak consumer and business confidence. Company profits have also been impacted, led by a decline in mining profits. The Reserve Bank of Australia left rates unchanged at its February meeting, with the official cash rate of 4.25%. The Australian dollar was largely steady in February, increasing by 1.6% over the month against the US dollar to US$1.06.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Equity markets delivered strong returns in January, as investors reacted positively to better than expected US economic data and the European Central Bank&rsquo;s efforts to support the stability of the banking system. Australian equities returned 5.1% in January while the developed overseas equities benchmark was up 4.5% in fully hedged terms. However, the appreciation of the Australian dollar impacted returns earned by Australian investors, with the developed overseas equities benchmark up 1.2% in unhedged Australian dollar terms. Emerging markets equity delivered the strongest performance, with returns of 7.4% over the month in Australian dollar terms. Fixed interest showed more subdued performance, but remains the strongest performing asset class over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>The economic outlook for Europe remains poor, with most indicators suggesting that Europe is close to, or already in, a recession. The European sovereign debt crisis has weighed on markets for some time, and concerns remain about the level of government debt and the lack of competitiveness in some countries.&nbsp; In January, the European Central Bank took further steps to support European financial institutions, reducing the likelihood of a banking crisis. European leaders also announced further steps to increase the level of fiscal integration across the European Union. These measures helped to improve investor confidence in the Euro zone, and as a result, the cost of debt declined for countries such as Ireland, Italy and Spain. While these were positive steps, the longer term issue of underlying government debt levels remains unresolved.</p>
<p>The European sovereign debt crisis has also affected the outlook for the US economy, and growth forecasts have been progressively revised down. The US government also continues to run large deficits, and efforts to reduce the level of government debt are likely to weigh on growth over the longer term.&nbsp; However, in recent months, US economic data has been better than expected. This has driven the relatively steady performance of US equities, particularly relative to European equities.&nbsp; The unemployment rate continued to fall in January, down from 8.5% to 8.3%. Consumer and business confidence also showed signs of improvement, although these remain at very low levels.&nbsp; Overall, US economic indicators continue to point to positive, but modest, growth.</p>
<p>Emerging market economies generally have lower levels of private and government debt, and continue to have a favourable outlook relative to the developed world. However, growth in the emerging world has eased due to the slowdown in the US and European economies. Export growth to the developed world has slowed, and emerging economies have also felt the impact of tight monetary policies (higher interest rates) introduced last year to combat high and rising inflation. That said, there are signs that inflation is easing, led by a fall in food inflation.&nbsp; Many emerging market policymakers also have the ability to respond with fiscal and monetary stimulus measures should conditions deteriorate further.</p>
<p>The slowdown in the emerging world is likely to impact the Australian economy. Australia&rsquo;s bulk commodity export volumes continue to be strong, although prices have declined. Confidence levels have been affected by the ongoing uncertainty in Europe, with both consumer and business confidence levels remaining weak. The Australian dollar appreciated over January, in line with the increase in investor risk appetite.&nbsp; It increased by 3.7% against the US dollar, to end the month at $1.06.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Investor sentiment continues to be affected by concerns regarding the solvency of heavily indebted European governments and increasing levels of stress within the European banking system. Signs of a slowdown in emerging market economies have also weighed on markets. As a result, equity markets delivered mixed performance in December, capping off a very volatile year. Global equity markets were flat overall while Australian equities were down over the month.</p>
<p>Over the 2011 calendar year, defensive assets such as fixed income performed well while equity returns were disappointing. Fixed income investors benefited from the decline in government bond yields over the year (with the exception of those of financially stressed European countries) due to slowing global growth and the likelihood of low interest rates for an extended period of time. Emerging market equities underperformed, down 18% in Australian dollar terms, while Australian equities declined almost 11% over the year. Developed overseas equities fared better, but still fell by 5% over the year.</p>
<p>Developing economies as a whole continue to grow, however, the pace of growth has slowed due to the impact of the global economic slowdown and earlier monetary policy tightening. Exporters in the emerging world have been affected by the deteriorating outlook in Europe and the US, with export growth slowing meaningfully over recent months. Chinese GDP data for the December quarter beat market expectations, showing annualised growth of 8.9%. While still strong, growth has moderated from previous quarters. On the positive side, consumer spending remains high and has exceeded expectations. In many emerging market economies, inflation has also begun to decline from previously high levels. As a result, emerging market policymakers have begun to focus more on growth concerns rather than combatting inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>The outlook for Europe remains poor, and economic indicators continue to suggest that Europe is currently in, or heading into, a recession. In early December, the European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates to 1% in an effort to support growth.&nbsp; The ECB has also continued to provide support to the financial system, acting in conjunction with the central banks of Canada, Japan, Switzerland and the UK. Many European governments face unsustainable borrowing costs (bond yields), placing enormous pressure on European leaders to find a lasting resolution to the crisis. Following the European Union Summit in early December, European leaders announced further steps towards fiscal integration, including stronger coordination of economic policies and greater budgetary oversight by the European Union. While positive, these moves failed to address the underlying solvency issues, and borrowing costs have remained high.</p>
<p>US economic data continued to be better than expected in December, however are still consistent with only moderate growth. The labour market showed signs of improving, with the unemployment rate falling to 8.5% (from 8.7%). The closely watched ISM Manufacturing Index was also slightly better than expected, pointing to modest growth in the manufacturing industry. While these outcomes are encouraging, the size of the US government deficit and rapidly rising government debt levels are key concerns for the longer term outlook. Higher taxes or spending cuts required to reduce the government deficit are likely to be a headwind to the US economy in years ahead.</p>
<p>The Australian economy has continued to outperform relative to most of the developed world, however growth remains uneven. The mining industry has experienced robust growth, and non mining business investment and activity remain strong. On the other hand, some sectors, such as housing and retail, have struggled.&nbsp; The Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates again in early December, bringing the cash rate to 4.25%. The RBA remains concerned about the impact of the global slowdown on Australia&rsquo;s major trading partners and the potential for the European crisis to deteriorate further. The Australian dollar was relatively stable in December, declining by 0.7% versus the US dollar.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Equities declined in November, as markets remain focussed on European sovereign debt issues and the slowdown in global economic growth.&nbsp; In local currency terms, the global MSCI World price index fell by 1.5%, while the US S&amp;P 500 index fell by just 0.5%. Australian equities underperformed over the course of the month, with the S&amp;P/ASX 200 index declining 4.1%. Japanese equities and emerging markets equities also underperformed in November.</p>
<p>The US economy continues to face the challenges of high unemployment and high government and private debt levels. That said, US economic data continued to beat market expectations in November, and most indicators remain consistent with positive, albeit modest, growth. The unemployment rate fell to 8.6% in November, down from 9.0%. However, most of this decrease was due to a fall in the participation rate as people abandoned the search for work. The labour market remains weak, and the creation of jobs in the private sector has been partly offset by the continuing loss of public sector jobs.</p>
<p>The outlook for Europe remains highly uncertain, as policymakers have struggled to find a lasting resolution to the sovereign debt crisis, which now affects larger economies such as Italy. Following the European Union Summit held in early December, European leaders announced moves towards further fiscal integration, aiming to restore confidence to markets. While these were positive steps, markets were ultimately disappointed by the absence of a clear resolution to the crisis, as solvency questions largely remain. The deepening crisis now also threatens the outlook for the largest economies in the Euro zone, France and Germany. Ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s placed both of these countries&rsquo; AAA long term credit ratings on negative watch in early December, citing the potential impact of the &ldquo;deepening political, financial and monetary problems within the European Economic and Monetary Union&rdquo;. This has placed additional pressure on European leaders to find a resolution to the crisis, and developments are likely to continue to drive market volatility in the coming months.</p>
<p>The uncertainty surrounding sovereign debt has also affected European economic growth, with most indicators remaining at levels consistent with a recession.&nbsp; Growth has slowed in France and Germany, while deteriorating sharply in countries such as Spain and Italy. Ongoing uncertainty, coupled with harsh austerity measures, has hurt confidence, leading to a rapid reduction in business activity. The European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates to 1% in early December. The ECB has also continued to take steps to support the banking system, including taking coordinated action to increase liquidity in conjunction with the central banks of Canada, Japan, Switzerland and the UK.</p>
<p>Growth in the developing world has also slowed in recent months. Europe and the US remain important export markets for China and other developed markets, and the slowdown in these regions will impact emerging countries. Export growth has slowed meaningfully in China, particularly export volumes. In response to weaker conditions, central banks in many countries have taken policy steps to promote borrowing and support economic growth, such as cutting interest rates. Low government debt levels also mean that emerging countries are better placed to respond to slower growth with fiscal stimulus measures.</p>
<p>While the Australian economy continues to perform well relative to most of the developed world, European sovereign debt issues and concerns about a slowdown in China have impacted consumer and business confidence. The unemployment rate also increased slightly to 5.3% in November. The Reserve Bank of Australia cut interest rates for the second successive month in December, reflecting concern about the uncertain global outlook. Markets are anticipating further interest rate cuts in the coming year.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar has experienced significant volatility over the last few months, and fell by 2.3% versus the US$ in November, to US$1.03. Defensive asset classes such as fixed interest performed well during the month, and Australian fixed interest in particular has provided strong returns over the last 12 months.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Equity markets rallied strongly in October, ending several months of negative returns. The Australian S&amp;P/ASX 200 Price Index was up 7.2% over the course of the month and global equity markets also experienced similar gains. The US S&amp;P 500 Index was up 10.8% and the MSCI World Price Index up 8.5%, both in local currency terms. Strong gains during the month reflected hopes that comprehensive action from European policymakers would help to resolve the sovereign debt crisis.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the month, European leaders announced a series of measures designed to address the escalating sovereign debt crisis. These included an increase in the size of the European bailout fund through leverage, a planned recapitalisation of the banking system and a &lsquo;voluntary&rsquo; 50% private sector hair cut on Greek government bonds which would reduce the projected debt burden for Greece. This agreement was reached after a lengthy period of negotiations, reflecting the difficulty in designing a plan which would be acceptable by all the parties involved. However, in early November, shortly after the announcement of the deal, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou announced that he would put the latest bailout package to a referendum for the people of Greece, calling into doubt Greece&rsquo;s willingness to enact the harsh austerity measures called for as part of the agreement. This raised the prospect of a disorderly Greek default, causing a sharp and sudden selloff in equity markets. Papandreou later withdrew the referendum call after the main opposition party indicated that they would back the bailout package. Days later, Papandreou resigned as Prime Minister, to be replaced by an interim prime minister under a unity government. This highlights the difficult task political leaders face in maintaining support for unpopular austerity measures being demanded in exchange for bailouts. As such, market volatility is likely to continue as these developments unfold.</p>
<p>Within the US, the high unemployment rate of 9.0% in October continues to weigh on consumer confidence and spending, and thus economic growth. While the unemployment rate fell slightly during the month, the modest rate of jobs creation remains insufficient to achieve a substantial reduction in the unemployment rate. Overall, most key economic releases remain consistent with low growth, as opposed to economic contraction or recession.</p>
<p>Emerging market economies fared relatively well through the previous global recession, and growth remains strong compared to the developed world. Some emerging countries face high inflation, and central banks had been increasing interest rates in order to reduce inflationary pressures. That said, the global economic slowdown has also affected growth in the emerging world, and as a result, many central banks have moved from a tightening bias to a more neutral policy stance, with some already cutting interest rates.</p>
<p>In Australia, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut the official cash rate to 4.5% in November. The rate cut reflects concern over the slowdown in the global economic growth, and weakness in some sectors of the economy. While the overall outlook for the Australian economy remains favourable relative to the rest of the developed world, export oriented industries which have not benefitted from the mining boom (such as manufacturing and tourism) have struggled with the high Australian dollar and higher interest rates. Consumer and business confidence also remain weak, at levels consistent with weak or negative economic growth.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar appreciated substantially over the course of the month, increasing 9% versus the US dollar to end the month at US$1.05. The Australian dollar tends to perform well when risk markets rally. However, the strong risk rally also saw defensive asset classes such as fixed interest underperform in October. Both Australian and overseas fixed interest delivered negative returns as government bond yields increased.</p>

            <summary><![CDATA[Over the last several months, equity markets have declined significantly, reflecting concerns about the slow pace of economic growth and unresolved European sovereign debt issues.]]></summary>
            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Over the last several months, equity markets have declined significantly, reflecting concerns about the slow pace of economic growth and unresolved European sovereign debt issues. Markets fell further in September, with the US S&amp;P 500 Index down 7.2% and the MSCI World Price Index down 6.3%, both in local currency terms. The Australian S&amp;P/ASX 200 Price Index fell 6.7% over the course of the month. Equities have performed poorly since the start of the financial year, however, markets rallied in early October, reclaiming some of these losses.</p>
<p>The global economic uncertainty has impacted consumer and business confidence in Australia, and there are signs that the economy has begun to soften. Consumers remain cautious, and have continued to save more of their income, with the savings rate near 20 year highs. As a result, retail sales growth has been weak. The unemployment rate increased to 5.3% in September, up from 4.9% in April. While the unemployment rate remains low by international standards, the level of full time jobs growth has slowed meaningfully.</p>
<p>Within the US, employment growth remains weak and the unemployment rate has stayed high at 9.1%. US federal and state governments have cut spending in order to reduce deficits. This reduction in public sector jobs has partly offset the creation of jobs in the private sector. Economic indicators improved slightly during the month, and are at a level consistent with modest growth as opposed to contraction or recession. However, some sectors of the economy remain weak, and small business confidence remains very low. This is a concern as small businesses have traditionally been drivers of US growth and job creation.</p>
<p>European sovereign debt concerns continued to dominate headlines and these issues also threaten the health of the European financial system. European banks hold the majority of European sovereign debt, and many institutions&rsquo; solvency would be impacted in the event of a debt default or restructure. There has been an increased commitment from European leaders to recapitalise the banking system, and the European bailout fund was recently increased to &euro;440 billion. That said, policymakers have yet to find a sustainable solution. Economic conditions continued to decline during the month, with heavily indebted economies such as Greece, Ireland, Spain and Italy experiencing the sharpest declines. Growth in the &lsquo;core&rsquo; economies such as Germany and France has also moderately substantially, with indicators suggesting little or no economic growth. This has led to increasing risk that Europe is close to a recession.</p>
<p>Growth in the emerging world has slowed, largely due to authorities&rsquo; attempts to cool economies to rein in high and rising inflation. That said, a downturn in Europe and the US would also have an impact on these economies, and as a result central banks have moved to a more neutral policy stance. Chinese consumer price inflation was 6.1% in the year to September, in line with market expectations.</p>
<p>The increase in investor risk aversion saw government bond yields fall further during the month (that is, prices have risen). As a result, Australian and overseas fixed interest have delivered strong returns over the month, and over the last 12 months. Markets have priced in the likelihood of interest rate cuts in Australia, which has put downwards pressure on the Australian dollar. The value of the Australian dollar fell substantially during the month, decreasing by 9.8% against the US dollar.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Economic and Market Summary - August 2011]]></title>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Since the middle of July, share markets have experienced heightened volatility reflecting the spreading contagion of the European sovereign debt crisis and a sharp slowdown in leading economic growth indicators. Equity markets extended their losses in August, with most markets experiencing material declines. In local currency terms, the US S&amp;P 500 Index and the broader MSCI World Price Index were down 5.7% and 7.0% respectively.&nbsp; While the Australian equity market also declined, it outperformed relative to the major overseas markets, with the S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index down 2.9%.</p>
<p>European sovereign debt issues were a key focus of markets during the month. Despite numerous bailout packages announced over the last several months, concerns remain about debt levels in countries such as Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy. Bond yields for these nations have continued to rise as investors seek higher returns to compensate for the risk of losses resulting from a potential debt restructure or government default. The European economy has also continued to slow, particularly in the heavily indebted periphery. This partly reflects the impact of harsh austerity measures.</p>
<p>Sovereign debt issues and the health of the European banking system are interlinked, as a large proportion of European sovereign debt is held by European banks. As such, many European financial institutions are facing increasing levels of stress and the cost of insuring these companies against default has risen to levels higher than at the peak of the Global Financial Crisis. Many European banks have seen their share prices fall significantly, which contributed to the underperformance of European equity markets during the month. The German DAX was down over 19% while the French CAC decreased by more than 11% during August.</p>
<p>The US economy continues to struggle with persistent high unemployment and poor consumer and small business confidence. Confidence has been affected by the dysfunctional political environment as well as the uncertain global economic outlook. Leading economic indicators continued to point to an increasing chance that the US economy could experience a material slowdown or a recession. For example, the August Philadelphia Federal Reserve manufacturing survey recorded its worst result since March 2009, with levels of manufacturing activity consistent with a recession.&nbsp; That said, the closely watched ISM manufacturing and services indices remained at levels suggesting low, but positive growth.</p>
<p>While economic conditions appear to be worsening, policymakers have limited policy options to further stimulate the economy, and this has weighed on market confidence. Interest rates in the US remain close to zero, limiting the US Federal Reserve&rsquo;s ability to stimulate the economy through monetary policy. During the month, the US Federal Reserve committed to keeping interest rates steady until 2013, signalling to markets that the low interest rate environment will persist for some time. Several prominent Republicans have been critical of the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s actions and the hostile political environment has also constrained the US government&rsquo;s ability to provide further fiscal stimulus (through reduced taxes or increased spending). Any measures which would increase the size of the deficit face fierce resistance from the opposition party Republican controlled Congress.</p>
<p>Emerging market economies continue to face inflationary pressures, however policymakers in a number of countries have been proactive in taking measures to cool their economies and reduce inflation. These measures have also seen growth in the emerging market economies continue to decelerate somewhat. In China, the most recent consumer price inflation figure came in at 6.2% for the year to August, still high, but in line with market expectations.</p>
<p>The Australian economy continues to have a positive outlook overall, relative to the rest of the developed world. While the mining sector has benefited from continuing strong demand from emerging markets, other sectors of the economy have been impacted by higher interest rates and the high Australian dollar. Increased global uncertainty has also impacted business and consumer sentiment. For example, the Australian Industry Group&rsquo;s August survey of the construction industry showed activity at its lowest level in two and a half years. The unemployment rate showed a small, but unexpected, increase in August (reaching 5.3%), driven by a loss of full time jobs.</p>
<p>Fixed interest markets rallied during August due to the increase in investor risk aversion. During the month, US 10 year treasury yields fell to levels lower than those experienced at the height of the Global Financial Crisis, reflecting strong inflows into the asset class. Despite concerns about the US deficit and debt levels, investors continue to view US treasuries as a safe haven. Global fixed income outperformed Australian fixed income over the month, however, Australian fixed income continues to outperform over the 12 months to end August. The Australian dollar declined by 2.6% versus the US dollar during the month, largely reflecting an increase in investor risk aversion.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Equity markets were down sharply in July, reflecting weak macroeconomic data out of the US, the political impasse over raising the US Government debt ceiling and ongoing sovereign debt concerns in Europe. During the month, equity markets suffered some of the largest weekly falls in more than a year, and this selloff in risk markets continued into the first few weeks of August. Consistent with the increase in investor risk aversion, fixed interest markets rallied during July as bond yields fell. Australian fixed income outperformed global fixed income over the month, as well as over the 12 months to end July.</p>
<p>Economic data out of the US has been disappointing for some months, leading to increasing fears of a double dip recession. The latest US GDP data release contained substantial downward revisions to GDP figures for the previous two years. This showed that the recession associated with the Global Financial Crisis was even more severe than previously thought and that two years after the official end of the recession, GDP is yet to fully recover. The preliminary estimate of US GDP for the June 2011 quarter was also below market expectations, with growth of 1.3% annualised. Consequently, growth over the 12 months to June 2011 was just 1.6%, which is a level that historically has often been followed by a recession.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, July payrolls data in the US surprised on the upside, with 117,000 jobs created compared with expectations of an 85,000 gain. As a result, the unemployment rate declined slightly to 9.1%. The private sector accounted for all the jobs created during the month, offset by a decline in government jobs (37,000). Government jobs have declined for nine consecutive months, and are likely to continue to decrease due to fiscal consolidation efforts by Federal, state and local governments. Congress&rsquo; standoff over the increase in the debt ceiling has shaken confidence in the US political system, while focussing attention on the size of the country&rsquo;s fiscal problems. Addressing these problems, by increasing taxation or reducing spending, is likely to be a drag on economic growth.</p>
<p>Growth across Europe has also begun to slow, and some indicators are even suggesting that the Euro zone may be close to entering a phase of contraction.&nbsp; Sovereign debt issues continued to dominate in Europe, as markets question the adequacy of the policy response to the crisis. There is increasing concern about the contagion of these issues from some of the smaller, heavily indebted countries to large economies such as Spain and Italy. These countries make up a significant proportion of the European economy and because of their size, a bailout would quickly exhaust the existing bailout fund. Yields on Spanish and Italian government bonds have risen, increasing debt servicing costs for these countries. The European Central Bank intervened to provide some relief for these countries by buying Italian and Spanish debt, driving yields lower.</p>
<p>During July, the European Council agreed on a second rescue package for Greece and strengthened the region&rsquo;s bailout mechanism to offer protection to other key economies in order to further support financial stability in the Euro zone.&nbsp; Additional funds for Greece are to be provided at a much lower interest rate than currently being paid. However, even with these measures, the country&rsquo;s government debt to GDP ratio will still be well in excess of 100 percent for many years and the government faces significant implementation risks to fiscal and economic reform.</p>
<p>Growth in China and the rest of the emerging world continues to slow. While the outlook for emerging market economies remains favourable relative to the developed world, many emerging markets face high inflation. For example, inflation in China was 6.5% in the year to July, higher than markets were expecting. This has led to authorities tightening monetary policy (for example, raising interest rates) which has slowed growth.</p>
<p>The Australian economy continues to benefit from the resources boom and record terms of trade, which have helped to keep unemployment low. However, the economy as a whole continues to have a mixed outlook as consumer and business confidence levels remain low and certain sectors (such as tourism and retail) have been impacted by rising interest rates and the high Australian dollar. Inflation also continues to edge up, which had previously led many to expect the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to increase interest rates further. However, markets have since reassessed their expectations in light of financial market volatility and the deteriorating global economic outlook. As a result, markets are now expecting the RBA to cut interest rates substantially by the end of the calendar year.</p>
<p>Over the course of the month, the S&amp;P 500 was down 2.1% and the MSCI World Price Index was down 2.8%, both in local currency terms. Australian equities underperformed most other equity markets in local currency terms (with the exception of the French share market), with the S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index down 4.0%.&nbsp; During July, the Australian dollar appreciated by 2.5% against the US dollar, partly reflecting weakness in the US dollar. That said, the Australian dollar fell significantly during volatile trading in the first few weeks of August.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Most equity markets were lower in June, driven by weak economic data, concerns around Greek sovereign debt and a focus on the cooling Chinese Economy.&nbsp; US macroeconomic data releases were weaker than expected. While the data suggests that US growth has moderated, this suggests slow, but positive, growth rather than an economic contraction. The US unemployment rate remains high, increasing slightly during the month to 9.2%. The slow pace of economic growth has failed to result in meaningful job creation in the private sector and government jobs continue to decline as a result of budget cuts. Jobs data for June was worse than expected, with just 18,000 jobs created, significantly short of consensus estimates of around 100,000. Chronic high levels of unemployment are likely to persist in the US for some time unless there is a meaningful increase in the rate of job creation.<br /><br />Growth in Europe also eased, however, the economies of France and Germany continue to outperform Europe as a whole. Economic indicators have been poor in Italy, Spain and Ireland, while the Greek economy continues to contract, reflecting the impact of austerity measures and the sovereign debt crisis. In July, the European Central Bank raised interest rates to 1.5%, the second increase since the end of the GFC. Core consumer price inflation in the Eurozone is currently at 1.8%, just below the target of 2%. In the UK, the Bank of England has yet to increase interest rates, despite high inflation (4.5% headline and 3.9% core). It remains in the difficult position of balancing inflationary pressures with high unemployment levels and soft GDP growth.</p>
<p>While growth in emerging market economies remains robust overall, the outlook has weakened due to concerns of softening demand as a result of fiscal and monetary policy tightening. In many emerging countries, authorities have acted to cool their economies in light of high and rising inflation. Leading economic indicators of Chinese growth continued to moderate during the month, suggesting that these measures have begun to impact growth.&nbsp; However, despite these measures, Chinese consumer price inflation data came in higher than markets were expecting, with prices rising 6.4% in the year to June.</p>
<p>The outlook for the Australian economy as a whole remains reasonably positive due to continued strength in Australia&rsquo;s terms of trade (which measures the price of Australia&rsquo;s exports relative to imports). This has been driven by an unprecedented boom in the mining sector, but has hurt the retailing, tourism and manufacturing industries which have felt the impact of higher interest rates and the increase in the Australian dollar. Concerns around cost of living increases and global economic uncertainty saw consumer confidence fall further while the savings rate has increased to a level not seen in more than 20 years. Many are now considering the possibility that Australia&rsquo;s two speed economy could persist in the medium to long term, reflecting structural change in the economy to accommodate the strong mining sector.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar remains extremely elevated relative to its long term average due to continued demand for Australian commodities as well as the very wide interest rate differentials that exist between Australia and most other developed world economies. After reaching new post float highs in May against the US dollar, the Australian dollar remained steady in June, ending the month at US$1.07.</p>
<p>During June, equities sold off, with the S&amp;P 500 down 1.8% and the MSCI World Price Index down 1.7%, both in local currency terms. Australian equities underperformed most other equity markets, with the S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index down 2.1%. Fixed income rallied during June with Australian fixed income outperforming global fixed income over the month (and over the 12 months to end June).</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>US macroeconomic data was softer than expected in May, suggesting that the rate of growth in the US economy may be slowing. Labour market data disappointed, with just 54,000 jobs created during the month, significantly below consensus estimates of around 195,000 and the average level over the prior three months (220,000). The unemployment rate increased slightly to 9.1%. Private sector jobs growth remained weak while government jobs continue to decline, reflecting job cuts by state and local governments. The closely watched ISM manufacturing economic indicator was also much weaker than expected and the lowest reading in 12 months, pointing to a more subdued expansion for the manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>Sovereign debt concerns once again came into focus as European authorities failed to reach agreement on a fresh rescue package for Greece. The Greek government faces increasing political pressure domestically and continuing protests against austerity measures needed to stabilise debt levels and meet the obligations of the existing IMF/EU bailout. Greece&rsquo;s government debt burden is approaching &euro;340 billion or around 150% of GDP, and this level is projected to increase further as the Greek economy contracts. Markets remain concerned about the possibility of a Greek government default, and are currently pricing a significant probability of a default or restructure over the next two years. This could have significant implications for the stability of the financial system, as it is understood that exposure to Greek debt is concentrated in a number of French and German banks. The potential for contagion risk for countries such as Portugal and Ireland is also a material concern.</p>
<p>Despite the issues in peripheral Europe, the core European economies of France and Germany continue to perform well. The European Central Bank increased interest rates to 1.25% in April (the first increase since the global financial crisis), and is expected to raise rates further later in the year in light of accelerating inflation.</p>
<p>In Australia, the commodity and agricultural sectors continue to perform well. However, many other sectors are struggling with the high Australian dollar, relatively high interest rates and a cautious consumer. Consumer sentiment declined in May, and the household savings rate increased to a level not since seen the global financial crisis. This has hurt the consumer discretionary sectors, while retail sales have also been impacted by fierce online competition (fuelled by the strong Australian dollar). The Australian economy contracted by 1.2% in the March quarter of 2011, mainly reflecting the impact of the Queensland floods which resulted in a fall in resource exports (particularly coal). While the contraction was larger than expected, many expect growth to recover swiftly as production and exports resume. The RBA has kept interest rates on hold since the last increase in November 2010 to 4.75%. The Australian dollar ended May at US$1.07, declining by 2.6% over the course of the month.</p>
<p>While the longer term outlook remains favourable, growth in emerging market economies has also begun to slow, reflecting the impact of fiscal and monetary policy tightening in a number of countries to rein in high and rising inflation. In particular, markets remain focussed on the slowing in the Chinese economy and the possibility that excessive tightening could result in a &lsquo;hard landing&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Weaker economic data and Greek sovereign debt concerns saw equities sell off during May. The Australian equity market saw some of the largest falls, with the S&amp;P/ASX 200 declining 2.4% over the course of the month. The S&amp;P 500 decreased by 1.4% and the MSCI World Price Index was down 1.7%, both in local currency terms. However, the fall in the Australian dollar offset some of these declines for unhedged Australian dollar investors.</p>
<p>Fixed income markets rallied during the month, due to the weakening global economic outlook. The global fixed income benchmark outperformed the benchmark for Australian fixed income over the month, although it remains marginally behind over 12 months.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>The improving macroeconomic outlook and robust corporate earnings in the US saw global equity markets increase in April. Over the course of the month, the S&amp;P 500 index gained 2.8% and the MSCI World index gained 2.0%, both in local currency terms. However, the rising value of the Australian dollar detracted from unhedged returns earned by Australian investors. Concerns surrounding Greek sovereign debt, increasing inflationary pressures and the withdrawal of fiscal and monetary stimulus also continue to weigh on equity markets.</p>
<p>Economic data from the US continues to indicate that the economy is expanding, although the rate of expansion appears to be moderating. The closely watched ISM Manufacturing and Services indices show continuing strong performance in manufacturing while growth in the services sector is beginning to slow.</p>
<p>The initial release of March GDP data showed that the US economy grew by a 1.8% annual rate during the quarter, a slowdown compared to the 3.2% growth rate in the last quarter of 2010. This result was below market expectations of 2.0% and was driven by soft government spending, weaker residential and business investment and lower personal consumption. Employment continues to rise slowly, with around 268,000 jobs added in the private sector in April. Partially offsetting this was the loss of 28,000 government jobs over the course of the month. As state and local governments continue to face pressure to cut spending, the loss of government jobs is a risk to the US jobs recovery.</p>
<p>Markets remain worried about the level of sovereign debt in peripheral Europe.&nbsp; The situation in Greece is particularly concerning and many now consider that a restructure for Greece&rsquo;s government debt is the most likely outcome; however, the timing remains highly uncertain. As a result, peripheral European economies have underperformed, showing reduced output or only modest growth rates. At the same time, the core European economies, such as France and Germany, have performed strongly.</p>
<p>While the Chinese economy performed well through the Global Financial Crisis, economic growth has begun to moderate somewhat. The Chinese government raised interest rates on 5 April 2011 for the fourth time since mid October 2010 in an attempt to combat rising inflationary pressures. Chinese authorities have also raised the bank reserve requirement ratio several times in order to slow the growth of credit. These measures have resulted in slower economic growth over the past year, however one concern is that the Chinese economy could experience a hard landing as a result.</p>
<p>Relative to most of the developed world, the longer term outlook for the Australian economy as a whole remains positive. That said, the two speed economy is very evident and recent economic data remains patchy, suggesting that growth will be subdued in the shorter term. The Australian dollar reached new post float highs during April, reaching a peak of US$1.10. The strength of the Australian dollar reflects continued demand for commodities as well as the very wide interest rate differentials relative to other developed economies. Certain sectors, such as tourism, education and manufacturing have been impacted by the high Australian dollar and relatively high interest rates. On the other hand, commodity or agriculture based sectors continue to perform strongly.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P/ASX 200 price index was down 0.3% during the month, underperforming global equities in local currency terms. The subdued performance reflects the softer short term outlook for the Australian economy as non commodity based companies struggle with the high Australian dollar and interest rates. More directly, the high Australian dollar has negatively affected a number of large Australian companies which generate a significant proportion of their income from offshore (such as CSL, QBE Insurance Group and News Corporation).</p>
<p>Government bonds continued to rally in April, proving resilient to concerns about rising inflation and the record US deficit. US treasury yields declined during the month as the market bet on slowing economic growth and continued low interest rates from the US Federal Reserve. Australian government bond yields also declined slightly over the course of the month.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>The 11 March 2011 Japanese earthquake has resulted in a terrible loss of life as well as large economic ramifications for Japan. Global equity markets fell sharply immediately following the earthquake. However, most markets were ultimately resilient to this event, recovering the majority of this underperformance by the end of the month. Over the course of March, the S&amp;P 500 was down 0.1% and the MSCI World Price Index was down 1.5% in local currency terms, while the ASX 200 increased marginally by 0.1%. Emerging market equities were the strongest performer during the month, increasing by more than 4% in Australian dollar terms.</p>
<p>The earthquake and associated tsunami have resulted in significant damage to infrastructure, homes and factories in Japan and the World Bank has estimated that the cost could be between 2% and 4.5% of the country&rsquo;s GDP. In the short term, the Japanese economy is likely to be impacted by the shutdown of factories, supply chain disruptions and ongoing power disruptions. However, many expect GDP growth to be boosted by the reconstruction effort from the second half of this year.</p>
<p>While markets have recovered much of their initial losses from the earthquake and associated tsunami, many uncertainties around the potential for further disruptions to economic activity remain. The nuclear crisis at the Fukushima power plant has recently been upgraded from a category 5 to a category 7 level of severity (on par with Chernobyl). If risks continue to emerge, market volatility is likely to increase and global growth could be impacted.</p>
<p>US employment continued to increase in March, with private companies adding 230,000 jobs. However, this was partly offset by the loss of 14,000 government jobs. With on going budgetary problems for state and local governments and increasing pressure for fiscal reform at the Federal level, public sector jobs may come under further pressure. This represents a key risk to the US jobs recovery.&nbsp; The US ISM Manufacturing and Services growth indicators were both lower in March; however, they remain at levels consistent with a strong performing economy.</p>
<p>Inflation pressures are increasing in the US and across the globe, driven mainly by higher oil and food prices. Many emerging market economies are increasing interest rates in order to rein in escalating inflation pressures and the European Central Bank has recently increased interest rates for the first time since the global financial crisis. However, at this point markets do not expect the US Federal Reserve to lift interest rates in the near term.</p>
<p>European sovereign debt issues came back into the spotlight in March with Portugal becoming the latest peripheral European country to require bailout assistance. During the month, key European finance ministers signed an accord to establish the &ldquo;European Stability Mechanism&rdquo; which will act as a permanent bailout fund from 2013 and will be able to lend up to &euro;500 billion (around A$690 billion). While substantial, a fund of this size would not be large enough to bail out the larger European economies, such as Spain, if ultimately required.</p>
<p>Despite the ongoing uncertainty around peripheral European economies, the broader European Union continues to perform solidly. The economic recovery of core European countries, such as Germany and France, continues to strengthen in contrast to the weakening in other nations such as Italy, Spain and Ireland.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;two speed&rsquo; Australian economy continues to be evident as commodity and agricultural sectors are performing well while most other sectors continue to struggle with the high Australian dollar, relatively high interest rates and a cautious consumer. The RBA has not raised rates since the increase to 4.75% in November 2010. During the month, the Australian dollar reached new post float highs, appreciating by 1.4% against the US dollar to end the month at US$1.03.</p>

            <summary><![CDATA[Equity markets have enjoyed a strong rally since mid-2010 and continued this positive performance in the first half of February. However, equity markets gave back some of the gains over the second half of the month over concerns regarding rising tens...]]></summary>
            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Equity markets have enjoyed a strong rally since mid-2010 and continued this positive performance in the first half of February. However, equity markets gave back some of the gains over the second half of the month over concerns regarding rising tensions in the Middle East, increasing oil prices and higher inflation. Over the course of the month, the S&amp;P 500 was up 3.2% and the MSCI World Price Index was up 2.8% in local currency terms. The potential for global oil supplies to be disrupted due to unrest in the Middle East is a risk facing markets given that higher oil prices would be expected to slow economic growth.</p>
<p>Within the US, the closely watched ISM Manufacturing and Services indices were higher in February, adding to several months of improvement. These economic indicators are at levels consistent with a strong economy and are the highest that they have been for several years. The improved outlook has occurred following substantial fiscal and monetary stimulus which is unlikely to be sustained in the longer term in light of the current political climate. Many state and local governments have begun to impose greater fiscal restraint and at the Federal level, the Republicans are pushing for large scale spending cuts.</p>
<p>Although US unemployment figures remain high, some leading indicators suggest that the US may soon see meaningful job creation with February non-farm payrolls (a key measure of US jobs growth) providing one of the strongest jobs growth outcomes for the US since the Global Financial Crisis. That said, the current high level of&nbsp; unemployment coupled with ongoing weakness in consumer confidence and spending suggest that it may be some time before we see unemployment return to more normal levels.</p>
<p>Equity markets in emerging markets have deteriorated in recent months with many nations facing high inflation, resulting in their central banks raising interest rates. In China, economic growth has turned down more recently, as authorities continue actions to rein in inflationary pressures. The Chinese manufacturing index has declined over recent months following a number of administrative measures and several interest rate rises to cool the economy.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P/ASX 200 price index increased by 1.6% during February. In recent months, the Australian market has generally underperformed developed overseas markets. The Australian market has been hampered by concerns about the impact of the slowdown in Chinese economic growth, while offshore markets have benefitted from improvements in the economic outlook in the US and Europe. The &lsquo;two-speed&rsquo; Australian economy was evident through the recent reporting season whereby commodity stocks reported strong earnings growth while most industrial companies reported flat to negative earnings growth. The RBA has held interest rates steady since the increase to 4.75% in November 2010.&nbsp; The Australian dollar appreciated over February against the US dollar to end the month at US$1.02, an increase of 2.1%.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>US economic data has improved for several months which is pointing to a pickup in the US economy&rsquo;s prospects, although driven in part by the country&rsquo;s stimulus measures. The closely watched ISM survey increased in January, reaching levels not seen since prior to the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>Despite the improving outlook, the US continues to experience high levels of unemployment. While the headline rate of unemployment decreased from 9.4% to 9.0% in January, the number of new jobs was materially lower than expected (36,000 new jobs compared to an anticipated 145,000). The decrease in the unemployment rate was mainly driven by a fall in the number of people looking for work. That said, the most recent data on unemployment has been heavily influenced by the very severe US winter which has had a larger than usual impact on labour force statistics, making it difficult to gauge the current trend in employment.</p>
<p>Overseas equity markets rallied in January, reflecting the improving economic outlook in the US and some countries in Europe. Over the course of the month, the S&amp;P 500 index was up 2.3% and the MSCI World price index increased by 1.9%, both in local currency terms. However, the Australian equity market started the year flat, partly reflecting concerns in relation to Chinese inflationary pressures. Over the month, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 was up 0.2%.</p>
<p>Reported Chinese inflation began to increase towards the end of 2010, driven primarily by strong increases in food prices. Authorities have introduced a number of measures in order to rein in inflation pressures, including a number of measures focussed on food prices in particular, such as cracking down on hoarders of food supplies and releasing part of Government stockpiles. Authorities have also raised interest rates in order to cool the economy and reduce underlying inflation pressures. The closely watched Chinese manufacturing index has decreased for several months, suggesting that these measures have begun to slow economic activity.</p>
<p>Given Australia&rsquo;s close linkages with China, a potential hard landing for the Chinese economy is a significant risk for the Australian economy. A meaningful slow down in the Chinese economy would likely have a significant flow on impact on the demand for Australian commodities and the Australian economy, as well as on growth more globally.</p>
<p>While the outlook for Australia in the longer term continues to be favourable compared with most of the developed world, the short term outlook is somewhat muted. The extensive damage in north eastern Australia caused by flooding and cyclone Yasi has led some economists to downgrade growth forecasts for the coming year. Queensland is a large exporter for the nation (with around a 20% share of exports in November) and is a key exporter of certain commodities, such as coal. That said, the impact on GDP may be uneven, with certain sub-sectors of the economy growing due to rebuilding efforts.</p>
<p>In January, the Australian dollar depreciated slightly against the US dollar, driven by improving news out of the US and the effect of Chinese inflation concerns. Over the course of the month, the Australian dollar depreciated by 2.7%, ending the month just below parity at US$0.997. The RBA has held rates steady at 4.75% since the last increase in November.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Equity markets ended the year on a positive note, with the S&amp;P/ASX 200 up by 2.5% and the S&amp;P 500 up by 6.5% in local currency terms over the course of the month. The markets&rsquo; strong performance reflects positive signs for the US with economic data improving and the approval of an extensive government stimulus package and further quantitative easing from the US Federal Reserve. That said, performance over the 2010 calendar year disappointed, with returns from Australian and developed overseas equities well below those of cash and fixed interest. Emerging markets equity performed better, but the unhedged return to Australian investors was impacted by the rapidly appreciating Australian dollar.</p>
<p>US growth indicators increased significantly in December, exceeding the previous peak achieved in April 2010 and pointing to stronger growth going into 2011.The results were strong in both the manufacturing and non manufacturing surveys and were consistent with an improving economy.</p>
<p>In December, the US Congress approved a bill which provides a large amount of short term stimulus to the economy, prompting economists to sharply increase their growth forecasts for 2011.The bill extends the Bush tax cuts for two years, includes a $120 billion payroll tax holiday and an extension to unemployment insurance. While markets reacted positively to the additional stimulus, concerns remain in relation to the longer term budgetary impact of the deal which will cost the US government US$850 billion over the next two years.</p>
<p>The US employment market showed continued signs of weakness as the more positive outlook for growth has yet to translate into strong jobs growth. US December payrolls data fell short of market expectations with just 103,000 jobs created compared with the expected increase of 150,000. The unemployment rate continues to be very high, however, the month also saw a large decrease in the size of the workforce which resulted in the rate falling from 9.8% to 9.4% (a broader measure of US unemployment, the U6 Index, saw the unemployment rate decrease from 17.0% to 16.7%).<br /><br />Chinese manufacturing activity has cooled as authorities tighten policy to combat inflationary pressures. The closely watched Chinese manufacturing index decreased in December, falling short of the median forecast. Chinese authorities raised key interest rates in December, the second move in less than three months. Inflation was reported at 5.1% in November, mainly reflecting a large increase in food prices.</p>
<p>The extensive damage caused by flooding in north eastern Australia has led some economists to downgrade their growth forecasts for 2011. Growth in the first half of the year is expected to be impacted by the disruption in the mining and agriculture sectors, although the second half may be stronger due to reconstruction work. The floods are also expected to result in an increase in food and commodity prices due to the disruption of supply. Recent record trade surpluses are likely to be reduced over the coming months due to the Queensland floods. Total exports from Queensland were $4.2 billion in November, 20% of total Australian exports.</p>
<p>After raising the cash rate to 4.75% in November, the RBA left rates on hold at its December meeting. Over the course of the month, the Australian dollar appreciated by 6.9%, driven by surging commodity prices. The Australian dollar ended the year at US$1.03 and has appreciated by 14% over the course of 2010.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Economic data in the US is showing continuing signs of improvement, albeit off a low base. Over the last several months, many key economic data releases have been more positive than expected and policymakers have introduced significant levels of stimulus, as discussed further below. This has led to improving sentiment, although the US economy continues to face some headwinds due to labour force weakness and the level of debt on consumer and government balance sheets. US labour force data has been surprisingly weak, with just 39,000 jobs created in November compared with the consensus forecast of 150,000 and the previous month&rsquo;s gain of 172,000. As a result, the unemployment rate increased to 9.8%. However, job openings in the US rose in October, signalling a pickup in job creation in early 2011.</p>
<p>Early in November, the US Federal Reserve announced that it would undertake US$600 billion of further quantitative easing, however this was widely anticipated by markets and was largely reflected in market prices of stocks and bonds. This is in many ways equivalent to printing money and is intended to stimulate growth by lowering interest rates and encouraging credit growth and business investment.</p>
<p>In December, the US Congress approved a tax cut bill which will provide a significant amount of short term stimulus to the US economy. The deal extends the Bush tax cuts for two years and includes a US$120 billion payroll tax holiday and an extension to unemployment insurance. The total value of the tax cut bill is an additional stimulus of US$858 billion over the next two years. The agreement prompted economists to sharply increase their growth forecasts for 2011.</p>
<p>Equity markets were down slightly in November. In local currency terms, the S&amp;P 500 decreased by 0.2% during the month. A key focus of markets in November was that of sovereign risk concerns for peripheral European economies, driven by the fiscal crisis in Ireland and fears that Portugal and Spain may face similar crises. Geopolitical tensions also weighed on stocks following an exchange of artillery fire between North and South Korea.</p>
<p>Japan&rsquo;s Nikkei saw strong gains during the month, primarily driven by strong US economic data and a weaker Yen which will benefit Japan&rsquo;s large export industry. The Nikkei was the best performing of the major equity indices, increasing by 8.0% in local currency terms during the month. Sentiment was also boosted by a Goldman Sachs prediction that the Nikkei will gain 20 percent in the next year.</p>
<p>The Chinese economy continues to show signs of strength and the closely watched manufacturing index showed that Chinese manufacturers were continuing to increase production. Inflation is also on the rise in China, with consumer prices increasing 5.1% in the year to November. This has prompted the government to crack down on hoarders and speculators as well as selling necessities from its stockpiles to ensure adequate supply. The government has also contemplated introducing price controls, signalling its determination to fight inflation.</p>
<p>The Australian economy grew by just 0.2 percent in the September quarter, half of what markets were expecting and the lowest rate of growth since December 2008. While disappointing, this result followed a 1.1 percent surge in growth in the June quarter, resulting in GDP growth through the year to September of 2.7%. The agricultural, forestry and fishing sectors saw strong growth during the quarter. However, the winding down of fiscal stimulus measures (such as the schools building program), higher interest rates and the stronger dollar impacted a number of sectors. The Australian equity market was also down in November with the S&amp;P/ASX 200 decreasing by 1.7% during the month. After raising the cash rate to 4.75% in November, the RBA left rates on hold at its December meeting.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Global equity markets continued to rally in October, driven mainly by the focus on further quantitative easing by the US Federal Reserve (QE2).&nbsp; Markets continue to position around the QE2 package, which will provide a meaningful increase in financial market liquidity that will result in downwards pressure on the US dollar, but upwards pressure on most risk assets and commodities in particular. In local currency terms, the S&amp;P 500 increased by 3.7% during the month. Most equity markets increased with the exception of the Nikkei which struggled on the back of a rapidly appreciating Yen/US dollar dynamic that is hurting their export sector.</p>
<p>Economic data out of the US in October was more positive than in recent months, providing some support to equity markets. Payroll data for October was stronger than expected with 151,000 jobs created during the month. While a good result, this rate of job creation would not be sufficient to reduce the unemployment rate given the growth in the underlying number of people seeking employment. The US ISM growth indicators rebounded sharply in October, significantly beating market expectations. The results were strong for both the ISM Services and ISM Manufacturing indices, with new orders increasing and inventories decreasing. While this suggests that the US economy&rsquo;s prospects are improving, this represents only one month of data and these series can be volatile from month to month.</p>
<p>Chinese economic growth indicators were also stronger than what markets were expecting. Strong domestic demand is driving production higher, while new export orders remained essentially unchanged. Input and output price inflation is on the increase in China, which is likely to put further upwards pressure on Chinese inflation. Concerned about the strength in the domestic economy, China&rsquo;s central bank surprised markets in October, lifting interest rates by 25 basis points, its first interest rate hike since 2007.</p>
<p>The RBA has maintained a hawkish view of the Australian economy, increasing the cash rate to 4.75% when it met on the 2nd of November. While this surprised financial markets, it was consistent with what most economists were forecasting and consistent with what the RBA had been communicating to markets. The RBA continued to cite concerns that very favourable terms of trade conditions and a strong labour market are likely to result in future inflation pressures. Money markets now anticipate one further interest rate rise over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar continued its upwards run, reflecting the strength of the Australian economy, Australia&rsquo;s meaningfully higher interest rates, weakness in the US economy and the expected impact of QE2. It increased by 1.8% against the US dollar, ending the month at 98 US cents. This resulted in lower returns from international equities on an unhedged basis.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Global equity markets rallied strongly in September, driven by economic data which was less negative than markets were pricing coupled with the prospect of further quantitative easing by the US Federal Reserve. In local currency terms, the S&amp;P 500 increased by 8.8% during the month. Other markets also performed strongly including emerging market equities (up 7.5% in local currency terms), the FTSE (6.2%) and the Nikkei (6.2%). The prospect of further quantitative easing renewed investors&rsquo; appetite for risk, put downward pressure on the US dollar (down 6.9% versus the Euro) and saw gold reach new highs.</p>
<p>Economic data in the US continues to be soft, suggesting that the recovery in the developed world will be sluggish. The US ISM economic indicators point to moderating growth in the US economy since April 2010. During the early stage of the recovery, the US economy received a strong boost due to the rebuilding of inventories, however this has slowed and demand continues to be weak.</p>
<p>The US Federal Reserve has suggested that further quantitative easing is likely, expressing concern about the slow pace of the economic recovery. The US Federal Reserve&rsquo;s aim is to stimulate the economy by lowering bond yields and therefore interest payments for governments, business and consumers. However, opinion is mixed on the likely effectiveness of this policy response, with some estimates suggesting a relatively modest impact on GDP growth. These actions also increase the risk of inflationary pressures further down the track.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) left cash rates on hold during September, however markets are expecting further interest rate increases over the next six to 12 months. The RBA has maintained a hawkish view, citing concerns that the strength of the economy could result in future inflation pressures. The RBA is particularly concerned about the boost to the economy from the very strong terms of trade, mainly reflecting the commodities boom. The Australian labour market is also strong and the low unemployment rate increases the risk of wage inflation at some stage.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar delivered strong gains during the month, reflecting both the relative strength of the Australian economy as well as the prospect of quantitative easing in the US. It ended the month at US97 cents, increasing by 8.5% against the US dollar during the month. This resulted in lower returns from international equities on an unhedged basis.</p>
<p>Over the course of September, there were a number of developments in currency markets. The Bank of Japan intervened to try to devalue the high Yen which is hurting its large export industry. China also appears to be gradually becoming even more resistant to global pressures to increase the pace of the revaluation of the Yuan which is at very low levels. A number of other countries also carried out or discussed currency intervention, including South Korea and Brazil. The concern over such intervention is that unilateralism becomes entrenched and that a currency war through protectionist mindsets drive policy decisions of central banks and governments. The IMF is concerned and is currently holding discussions with all major countries to try and ensure that an orderly adjustment to the current large global imbalances occurs.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Investment markets deteriorated in August, driven by weaker than expected economic data and increasing concerns about the slow pace of the US economic recovery.&nbsp; Global equities performed poorly during the month, giving up part of the July gains.&nbsp; The Australian equity market performed well relative to global markets, falling 1.1% compared with falls of 3.4% for the MSCI World index and 4.4% for the S&amp;P 500 index, both in local currency terms.&nbsp; Emerging markets continued to outperform developed markets, with the MSCI Emerging Markets index falling by 1.4% (in local currency terms) during the month.&nbsp; The Japanese equity market was the worst performing of the major markets, with the Nikkei down 7.5% in local currency terms.</p>
<p>Defensive sectors including Telecommunications, Healthcare and Utilities were the best performers during the month.&nbsp; Technology, Financials and Industrials were the hardest hit.&nbsp; August also saw a surge in corporate activity, including BHP Billiton&rsquo;s hostile bid for Canadian fertiliser maker Potash.</p>
<p>The US labour market remains weak, with the unemployment rate at 9.6% in August.&nbsp; This level understates the extent of unemployment as it does not account for the large increase in the number of people working part time because they are unable to find full time work.&nbsp; The economic recovery so far has not resulted in meaningful job creation and there are concerns that the employment situation could be deteriorating rather than improving.</p>
<p>US growth in the June quarter was revised to an annualised pace of 1.6%, down from an estimate of 2.4% issued a month earlier.&nbsp; US home sales plunged to their lowest level in 15 years following the recent expiration of the homebuyer tax credit.&nbsp; The US Federal Reserve indicated that it would be prepared to take additional action to spur growth should unexpected developments cause the recovery to falter.&nbsp; Reflecting the soft US macro-economic data over recent months, money markets have been pushing back the expected timing for the US Fed Reserve to increase cash rates.</p>
<p>Yields for low risk government bonds fell during the month, reflecting the deteriorating economic outlook.&nbsp; The yield on 10 year US Government bonds fell by 44 basis points during the month to 2.47%.&nbsp; Australian bond yields fell by the same amount to 4.76%.&nbsp; The fall in bond yields over the last few months has been less pronounced in Australia, reflecting the firmer domestic economic conditions and the &lsquo;safe haven&rsquo; status of US bonds.&nbsp; However, this has moderated somewhat in recent months.</p>
<p>Over the course of August, credit spreads widened marginally, consistent with the broader sell off in risk assets.&nbsp; Sovereign debt of some European economies with poor public debt and fiscal positions (for example, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy and Ireland) sold off sharply.&nbsp; More recently, most European countries have introduced austerity measures in order to give markets confidence that governments are committed to reducing public debt to more sustainable levels.</p>
<p>In Australia, the Reserve Bank of Australia left interest rates unchanged in August at 4.5%.&nbsp; Money markets are pricing in no change in rates over the next 12 months.&nbsp; Following a strong July, the Australian dollar sold off marginally against the US dollar on fears of slower economic growth, ending the month down 1.7% at US$0.89.&nbsp; Against most other major currencies, the Australian dollar was largely flat for the month, although it did have a moderate rally against the Euro.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Financial market sentiment improved in July, with the return of appetite for risk driving equity markets higher during the month. Fears of contagion from the Eurozone&rsquo;s fiscal crisis subsided which helped to lift market sentiment. Markets were also buoyed by the better than expected earnings results in the US and positive sentiment surrounding the results of stress tests conducted on European banks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that policymakers are making plans to withdraw fiscal support, as endorsed at the recent G-20 meeting, the weakness of global demand has come back into focus. Macro-economic data released in July suggested that the US economy is slowing as the boost from the rebuilding of inventories and policy stimulus fades. While some commentators believe a double-dip recession is likely, the data suggests only a slower rate of economic growth. US GDP growth in the June quarter slowed to an annualised 2.4% pace, a relatively lacklustre recovery given the worst downturn in activity since World War II.&nbsp; Economic growth in China has also slowed in recent months as authorities have introduced measures to reduce inflationary pressures and address a property bubble.</p>
<p>In Australia, one of the key downside risks for Australia continues to be the potential for China to slow more than is currently expected. Despite the labour market continuing to strengthen and the unemployment rate falling to 5.1%, the Reserve Bank of Australia left interest rates unchanged in July at 4.5%. While the Australian economy has performed well over recent quarters, there are indications it is beginning to slow. The slowing is particularly evident in the housing sector.&nbsp; For example, private sector housing approvals have fallen since late 2009.&nbsp; More recently, forward orders from the NAB Business Survey have fallen sharply, suggesting a material moderation in GDP growth.</p>
<p>After falling materially since late April 2010, global equity markets increased sharply in July, reflecting a very favourable US earnings season for the June quarter. In particular, there was significant improvement in the corporate sector&rsquo;s finances which have swung from deficit to surplus as profits have recovered. In the US, markets took heart from the gap between internally generated funds and investment spending which is at its widest for 50 years, indicating that firms are in a strong position to begin spending again. The MSCI global stock price index rose 8.0% (in US dollar terms) in the month, with emerging markets rising 8.3%. Emerging European markets were the best performers over the period, as they reacted positively to signs of diminishing Eurozone tensions.</p>
<p>In Australia, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index finished the month up 4.5% in July. The pro cyclical sentiment in the market during the month of July was reflected in the strong rebound in the Financials, Industrials, Materials and Resource sectors, while defensive sectors tended to underperform (for example, Telecom and Consumer Staples). Resource sector sentiment also improved after the new Prime Minister announced a revised resource tax which received general approval from the mining industry.</p>
<p>Sovereign bonds of the major developed economies have rallied (that is, prices have risen and yields have fallen) significantly over the last few months. Reflecting soft US macro-economic data, US 10 year bonds have rallied very significantly. While Australian bonds have also rallied over the last few months, the US bond market has significantly outperformed Australia&rsquo;s.&nbsp; From recent highs of around 4%, the US 10 year bond yield ended July at around 3%. The underperformance of Australian bonds versus US bonds reflects the more favourable growth outlook for the Australian economy, although this has moderated somewhat in recent months.</p>
<p>The return of appetite for risk saw the Australian dollar rally strongly against the US dollar over the course of July, ending the month at US90.4 cents. The Australian dollar is now around 25% above its post-float average, and is only moderately below its pre-Global Financial Crisis peak of around US98 cents. With the return of risk appetite in July, the Australian dollar found strong support on the back of demand for commodity based currencies and weakness in US economic data.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Investment markets deteriorated in June over concerns about the outlook for global growth. Data released in June indicated output and demand were continuing to expand, although some indicators suggested the pace may be slowing. However, the biggest moves were in confidence indices rather than in measures of output or demand, with sentiment indicators falling notably in June in both the US and Europe, with a smaller fall in Japan. Major international institutions &ndash; the OECD, the G20 and the IMF &ndash; have all recently recommended an early return to higher interest rates and a start on cuts in public spending.</p>
<p>Heightened uncertainty about the prospects for European debt and global growth has been reflected in increased volatility in financial markets. Market sentiment has become more cautious as prices have been more volatile. Prices for riskier assets, such as stocks and many commodities, continued to fall in June; safe haven assets such as government bonds and gold were preferred.</p>
<p>Stock markets fell during June, following on from losses in May. The MSCI global stock price index fell 3.8% in the month and 11.1% in the quarter. The poor final quarter to the financial year reduced the 12-month return on the index to 10.3%.&nbsp; Stock markets in emerging economies, where debt concerns are lowest and growth is highest, continued to perform better than those in developed markets. The MSCI emerging markets price index lost just 0.7% in June and increased by 17.3% over the financial year.</p>
<p>Offshore markets reacted negatively to US labour market developments, as well as European debt concerns. The US S&amp;P500 index fell 5.4% in June and volatility was above average.&nbsp; Germany&rsquo;s DAX index surprisingly was unchanged in the month of June, and fell just 3.1% in the quarter. In contrast, the UK&rsquo;s FTSE index fell 5.2% for the month and 13.4% for the quarter.&nbsp; The S&amp;P/ASX 200 Index fell 2.9% in June. Despite the heated debate about the impact of the Resource Profit Super Tax (RSPT), subsequently renamed the Minerals Resource Rent Tax (MRRT), the Australian market moved broadly in line with other developed markets &ndash; it fell 11.8% in the June quarter and rose 8.8% over the financial year.</p>
<p>The deterioration in the outlook for growth was reflected in falling yields for low-risk government bonds and wider credit spreads.&nbsp; After beginning the quarter at 3.83%, the yield on 10-year US Government bonds dropped another 35 basis points in June to end at 2.93%.&nbsp; This represented a decline of 61 basis points for the financial year.&nbsp; Australian bond yields also fell in June, by 28 basis points to 5.09% for 10 year bonds.&nbsp; The fall in bond yields has been less pronounced in Australia, reflecting the firmer domestic economic conditions and the special &lsquo;safe haven&rsquo; status of US bonds.&nbsp; Over the year to June, Australian bond yields declined by 43 basis points and the yield spread over US bonds increased to 216 basis points.</p>
<p>The Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) index of world commodity prices fell 1.4% in June and 2.8% in the quarter.&nbsp; Despite the weak June quarter, the CRB index still recorded an increase of 16.1% for the year to June 2010. Prices of commodities most closely linked to global growth bore the brunt of the falls in June, with copper, nickel and zinc all falling by more than 5%. However, like the broader index, these metals posted good rises of 15% or more over the financial year.&nbsp; Gold continues to be favoured, achieving record prices above US$1,260/oz during the month. The gold price rose 32.3% over the year, of which 12.1% occurred in the June quarter reflecting gold&rsquo;s status as a safe haven when markets are troubled. Despite the turbulence in markets, the Australian dollar appreciated 1% against the US dollar in June, ending the month at US$0.85. </p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Concerns about European governments&rsquo; debt problems dominated global financial markets in May, overshadowing more positive economic news about the global economic recovery.&nbsp; Progress on legislating changes to strengthen US financial market regulation &ndash; potentially reducing banks&rsquo; profits &ndash; also prompted selling of stocks and renewed demand for &lsquo;safe haven&rsquo; assets during May.</p>
<p>Markets were sceptical about the ability of the measures to address Europe&rsquo;s underlying fiscal problems, despite the announcement of three International Monetary Fund/European Union bailout packages, each larger than the previous one, and intervention by the European Central Bank to stabilise prices of European sovereign bonds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released new forecasts during May, revising up the 2010 growth outlook for most nations.&nbsp; However, most forecasters now expect global growth in 2011 to be below that in 2010 as government stimulus effects dissipate.&nbsp; The OECD, the IMF and the G20 are now all urging fiscal consolidation and the start to monetary tightening in most major economies.</p>
<p>Citing concerns about sovereign creditworthiness and the repercussions for financial markets, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) paused in its recent round of rate hikes, leaving the cash rate at 4.5% in early June.&nbsp; At the height of the financial instability in late May, money markets had almost fully priced in a 25 basis point cut in the official interest rate by September.&nbsp; However, the RBA noted that while developments in the global economy will need to be monitored, Australian economic growth will remain close to trend and inflation is likely to push the upper bound of the target range.</p>
<p>Global stock markets fell substantially, but it was difficult to discern the main causes.&nbsp; The MSCI world share price index fell 7.6% in May and emerging stock markets fell 5.6%. The US S&amp;P500 fell 8.2%, ostensibly due to concerns about European sovereign debt and the passing of tougher financial regulation that would reduce banks profits.&nbsp; While the US stock market fell sharply, the German stock market fell just 2.8%.&nbsp; On May 6, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1,000 points in a matter of minutes and then staged an almost complete rebound for reasons that US regulators are still trying to determine.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the ASX200 fell 7.9% in May, with the Resources sector performing better than other sectors despite the heated debate about the Resources Super Profits Tax (RSPT).</p>
<p>In this environment of heightened risk aversion, demand for low-risk government bonds increased and credit spreads widened.&nbsp; The yield on 10-year US Government bonds fell 37 basis points (bps) to 3.28%, although the yield on BAA-rated US corporate bonds rose 13 bps to 6.20%.</p>
<p>The Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) index of world commodity prices fell by 4.5% in May, with the gold price (+3.3%) benefitting from investment flows to safe havens.&nbsp; Base metals prices fell by 10% or more.&nbsp; Higher spot and contract prices for iron ore and coal supported the RBA&rsquo;s Australian commodity price index.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar depreciated 9.2% against the US dollar, finishing May at US84c.&nbsp; The Yen was the strongest of the major currencies, gaining 3.2% against the US dollar and 10.6% against the Euro.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>The latest International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts suggest that global economic growth will return to trend in 2010, with the world economy expected to post solid growth rates of over 4% in both 2010 and 2011. The IMF has upwardly revised its outlook for China and the United States, with a smaller improvement in the Japanese outlook. However, estimates for Europe stayed steady (and the IMF forecasts were finalised ahead of a worsening in the Eurozone crisis). The strength of the upswing in China, India and Australia has prompted the respective central banks to tighten monetary policy settings with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) raising the official cash rate to 4.5% in early May.</p>
<p>The Greek sovereign debt crisis has buffeted stock markets and riskier asset classes. The EMU is perceived to be ill-prepared to face the first big test of the strength of its unification, and this may result in renewed global financial instability. Fear of contagion spreading from Greece to other vulnerable European economies kept global stock markets under pressure. However, the EU/IMF rescue package for Greece has reduced the probability of a sovereign default in the EMU for now. Nonetheless, the episode showed how easy it is for fear and self-reinforcing market forces to drive asset prices.</p>
<p>Global stock markets experienced mixed fortunes over April. The US S&amp;P500 rose 1.5% due to favourable economic news and earnings reports. However, the MSCI world share price index was unchanged in April, European stock markets were weaker and China&rsquo;s Shanghai Composite dropped 7.7%. Meanwhile, the ASX200 fell 1.4%, led lower by weakness across the Resources sector (-4.1%).</p>
<p>The recovery of Australia&rsquo;s economy is set to continue. Data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed demand for housing remained strong with housing prices up by 20% over the past year. Meanwhile, underlying inflation in the March quarter 2010 averaged 0.7% (and 3.0% in the past year).</p>
<p>Early May saw the release of the Government&rsquo;s response to the Henry Tax Review. The Review recommended a range of measures, but the response was more limited. The new Resource Super Profits Tax is forecast to raise $9 billion in 2013-14. Other measures are focused on companies (lower company tax rate, accelerated deductions and the resource exploration rebate), a State Infrastructure Fund, and superannuation, including a lift in the Superannuation Guarantee rate from 9% to 12%.</p>
<p>The Commodity Research Bureau index of world commodity prices rose by 3.2% in April with gold (+5.9%) and oil (+2.9%) making gains, however some base metal prices were substantially weaker including aluminium ( 3%) and copper (-4.7%). Higher spot and contract prices for iron ore and coal caused the RBA commodity price index to jump by more than 10%.</p>
<p>On the foreign exchange market, the Australian dollar appreciated 1.6% against the US dollar, finishing April at US93c.&nbsp; The Pound was the strongest of the major currencies, gaining 1% against the US dollar and 2% against the Euro and Yen.</p>

            <summary><![CDATA[In March, global economic conditions continued to improve. In a few countries where prospects are favourable and the upswing is well established, fiscal and monetary policy settings are reverting to 'normal' levels faster than anticipated at the beg...]]></summary>
            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Financial markets continued to strengthen over the first quarter of 2010. The functioning for capital markets has improved significantly over the past year, with prices for risky assets generally rising relative to risk-free assets. Bank financing has been slower to recover; business credit continues to contract, albeit at a reduced pace, reflecting firms deleveraging and taking advantage of buoyant capital markets to raise funds.</p>
<p>Despite sizeable losses in the first month of 2010, global stock markets posted solid gains over the March quarter. The MSCI world share price index ended March up 6.2%, the largest monthly gain since July 2009, gaining 3.8% for the quarter. Developed markets were up 4.2% over the quarter and emerging markets reversed two months of declines in March to be up 1.1% over the quarter. The US benchmark index, the S&amp;P500, rose by 5.9% over March (to 1169), following a rise of 2.9% in February. Volatility declined 4.1% over the quarter. The ASX200 rose by 5.1% in March but did not regain the ground lost in January and, consequently, ended the quarter up just 0.1%.</p>
<p>US bond yields increased in March amid the strengthening economic climate &ndash; the 10-year bond yield increased 21 basis points to end the month at 3.83%, and is now on par with yields seen in mid-October 2008. The domestic market saw Australian 10-year bond yields rise by 35 basis points to end the quarter at 5.78%. Strong Australian data continued to see investors move away from safe haven assets, pushing down the price of Australian government debt. Corporate bond spreads continued to narrow over March, to be down over the quarter for both highly rated credits and riskier credits. In both the US and Australian corporate bond markets, riskier issuers saw the largest falls in premiums.</p>
<p>The CRB index of world commodity prices rose by a moderate 0.9% in March to be up 2.4% over the quarter, led by strong gains in base metals &ndash; steel was up 21.8% over the quarter and nickel was up 35.3% over the quarter. The RBA Index of Commodity Prices gained 2.6% over the first quarter of 2010 with most of the gains occurring in the early part of the year. Gold prices were down 0.3% to US$1109/oz over March, and oil prices gained 5.1% to end the quarter at US$84/bbl.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar ended the quarter at US$0.92, after appreciating 2.8% over March. Strong domestic economic news, commodity price gains and rising interest rates continue to put upward pressure on the Australian dollar. The US dollar lost 0.7% on a trade-weighted basis over March, reflecting the strengthening Canadian dollar, but appreciated 4.5% against the Yen. The Sterling is now close to a 12 month low against the dollar.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Global economic news in February was mixed, with recent optimism over the stronger economic outlook moderated by European fiscal worries and ongoing job losses in the United States. In Australia, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) surprised markets in early February by leaving the cash rate at 3.75%, arguing that the full impact of previous rate rises had yet to be felt.</p>
<p>Global financial markets are functioning considerably better than they were a year ago &ndash; thanks in large part to the degree of support and stimulus provided by central banks and governments. Financial markets as a whole are recovering in line with economic developments despite weak credit growth in most major economies. As a result, the extraordinary support measures deployed by governments and central banks during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) are now gradually being unwound. In Australia, most of the measures the RBA employed have been completely removed and the fiscal stimulus is being progressively withdrawn.</p>
<p>Global stock markets rose in February, but failed to recover all of the January losses. The MSCI world share price index increased by 1.5% in February. In contrast to recent months, developed markets led the way (up 1.8%), while emerging markets continued to decline (down 0.3%). The US benchmark index, the S&amp;P500, posted a gain of 2.9% to end the month at 1104 and the ASX200 gained 1.5% in February, after rallying 4.7% in the early weeks of the month. Volatility declined over the month as markets saw evidence of a strengthening financial system.</p>
<p>Global bond yields fluctuated within a 20 basis point range during February as markets were contained by positive economic news on one side and concerns about continuing policy uncertainty and Greece&rsquo;s dire fiscal position on the other. US 10-year bond yields ended the month up 3 basis points at 3.61%. Solid Australian economic data &ndash; particularly the surprise strength in employment figures over January &ndash; saw local bond yields rise by 6 basis points. In the US corporate bond market, spreads narrowed with the largest falls experienced by highly rated securities. The Australian corporate bond market, on the other hand, saw spreads widen.</p>
<p>The Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) index of world commodity prices (in US$) rose 2.9% in February, due to strong demand for oil and industrial metals as the global economy strengthened and US manufacturing lifted. Gains were led by nickel (up 14.4%), lead (up 6.9%) and copper (up 6.6%), as demand from China picked-up in the latter part of the month. In Australia, the RBA&rsquo;s Index of Commodity Prices (in US$) fell by 1.1% over February. Prices rallied 9.3% in the oil market, to end February at US$80/bbl, and the gold price finished the month up 2.8% to US$1112/oz.</p>
<p>The US dollar rose against European currencies, but fell against the Yen. The Australian dollar ended February at US$0.89, after losing 0.3% over the month. The RBA&rsquo;s surprise decision to leave the cash rate unchanged in early February saw the Australian dollar come under some pressure.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>The general improvement in world economic conditions continued in January with the IMF revising its forecast for economic growth in 2010 from 3.1% to 3.9%, followed by further growth of 4.3% in 2011. January saw a lift in US economic growth, but this was due mostly to a turn in the inventory cycle, and as yet, better growth has not translated into increased employment. In Australia, the RBA Board did not meet in January.</p>
<p>Despite further signs that the global recovery was consolidating, financial markets assumed a less optimistic tone as they seemed to recognise that the global economy has some way to go to work through the legacy of the GFC. Investor sentiment was weighed down by concerns about the high level of sovereign debt of some smaller European countries, uncertainty about the future path of bank regulation and the possible slowing of China&rsquo;s growth as a result of the central bank&rsquo;s tightening of monetary policy.</p>
<p>Reflecting the decline in investor sentiment, the MSCI global share price index dropped 3.8% in January and ended the month at its lowest level since November 2009, after peaking in mid-January. Emerging markets led the fall with a drop of 4.5%, wiping out some of the sizeable gains made in late-2009. The S&amp;P500 closed the month on 1073, a fall of 3.7% and the ASX200 posted its biggest monthly fall in 15 months (down 6.2%).</p>
<p>Bond markets saw prices rally (i.e. interest rates fell) and, despite positive economic growth data, ended January with US 10-year bond yields down 25 basis points to 3.58%. US markets displayed nervousness about the sustainability of economic growth and the risks posed by the sovereign debt levels of some small European countries. Domestically, Australian 10-year bond yields fell and closed the month at 5.38% as offshore influences set the tone. In corporate bond markets, riskier issuers saw larger falls in premiums than highly rated issuers and spreads decreased during January amid signs the US economy is beginning to strengthen.</p>
<p>The CRB index of global commodity prices fell 1.3%, after peaking at a 16-month high in early January. Base metals saw sizeable declines in prices amid fears of the impact of Chinese stockpiling on future demand and the expected growth slowdown brought on by the central bank&rsquo;s monetary policy tightening &ndash; prices for zinc, lead, aluminium and copper fell 17.2%, 16.7%, 8.4% and 6.9% respectively. Oil prices were down 8.2%.</p>
<p>The US dollar appreciated against most major currencies (except the yen) as the appetite for riskier or higher yielding assets faded, the outlook for the US economy firmed and the European markets were plagued by sovereign debt fears. The Australian dollar depreciated by 0.7% against a strengthening US dollar over the month.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>The global economic recovery which commenced in mid-2009 continued in December. The recovery has been underpinned by less risk aversion by consumers and corporates and very stimulatory monetary and fiscal policy. The rebound in growth has been sharpest in the emerging market economies (for example, China). Reflecting its strong linkages with the Chinese economy and stimulatory policy, Australia has also experienced a material rebound in growth over recent months.</p>
<p>In Australia, the Reserve Bank of Australia increased the cash rate by 25 basis points &ndash; to 3.75% &ndash; for a third consecutive month. The RBA noted the downturn in Australia was relatively mild, with measures of confidence signalling an economic recovery (business confidence reached its highest level since 2002). Deputy Governor Ric Battellino noted monetary policy has moved from emergency levels back towards a more normal stance. The latest ABS data indicates the economy grew by 0.2% during the September quarter and the November unemployment rate eased to 5.7%.</p>
<p>Financial markets maintained a broad improvement during December with global stock markets reaching their highest levels for 15 months. The MSCI global share price index rose 3.6% for the month (led by emerging markets). Overseas stock markets made broad gains &ndash; the UK gained 4.3%, Germany was up 5.9%, China rose by 2.6% and Japan&rsquo;s Nikkei increased 12.8%. The S&amp;P500 consolidated during December, gaining 1.8% as volatility continued to decline amid strengthening US economic data. The Australian market saw the ASX200 rise by 3.6% over the month, after peaking at 4870, a level last seen in September 2008.</p>
<p>Global bond yields increased in December reflecting the improved economic outlook, particularly in the US. US 10-year bond yields jumped to 3.84%, the highest level since early August and Australian 10-year bond yields rose to 5.64%. The Australia-US yield spread continued to narrow during December, ending the month at 181 basis points, the lowest level since April. In corporate bond markets, interest rate spreads over government bonds decreased.</p>
<p>The Commodity Resource Bureau (CRB) index of world commodity prices rose by 1.6% in December, as strong gains in industrial metals were partially offset by the declining price of gold (-5.8% to US$1105). Demand from China continued to bolster commodity prices over the month, with the CRB index reaching levels last seen in September 2008. The oil price finished the month up 2.7% to US$79/bbl reflecting declining inventories in the US. Nickel and zinc continued to post solid price gains and steel prices increased by 8.6% during December, following two consecutive months of declining prices.</p>
<p>The downward trend in the US dollar was interrupted during December. The US dollar rose to a three-month high against the yen as US economic data were better than expected. The Australian dollar ended the month at US$0.90 (down 1.4%), but appreciated 0.9% on a trade-weighted basis.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Economic and Market Summary - November 2009]]></title>
            <summary><![CDATA[Financial and economic conditions continued to improve in November – economic data signalled a gradual recovery was underway in most advanced and developing economies. OECD forecasts for GDP growth in 2009 and 2010 have been revised upwards.]]></summary>
            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Financial and economic conditions continued to improve in November &ndash; economic data signalled a gradual recovery was underway in most advanced and developing economies. OECD forecasts for GDP growth in 2009 and 2010 have been revised upwards.</p>
<p>Global stock markets regained momentum during November given the broad improvement in world economic conditions, and despite concerns over Dubai&rsquo;s credit default risk. The MSCI world share price index rose 2.9%, with emerging markets gaining a solid 3.2% and the S&amp;P500 total return index posting a gain of 5.7%. In other major economies, the performance of share markets was generally positive: the UK market increased by 2.9%, the main German index gained 3.9% and the Chinese market rose by 16.7%. However, Japan&rsquo;s Nikkei index was a notable exception, falling 6.9% during November due to concerns about the economic outlook.</p>
<p>Gains in Australia were smaller, with the ASX200 rising by 1.3% during November. By the end of November, the ASX200 was 50% above the low point reached in March 2009. Banking and financials continued to underperform retail and consumer staples.</p>
<p>The RBA increased the cash rate by a further 25bps to 3.5% in early November, continuing with recent decisions to lessen the degree of monetary stimulus. The Board noted that while inflation pressures persist, underlying inflation is expected to remain subdued. The latest economic data releases point to a gradual recovery &ndash; company profits fell for the fourth quarter and the pace of spending on business investment disappointed against expectations. However, retail sales, unemployment and car sales have improved.</p>
<p>Global bond yields fell during November, which appeared to be at odds with the rise in equity markets. The Australia-US 10-year bond spread narrowed, after peaking at 223bps mid-month. In corporate bond markets, there were further falls in risk premia.</p>
<p>As capital market conditions have improved over recent months, the use of bank credit facilities has eased and this is reflected in the decline in business credit growth. Australian corporates have focussed much of their attention on repaying debts to strengthen balance sheets and reduce gearing ratios and this has been at the expense of lending for acquisitions.</p>
<p>The Commodity Resource Bureau (CRB) index of world commodity prices rose 6.5% in November, due to strong demand for precious metals and industrial metals in the wake of improvements in the outlook for global economic growth. The gold price continued to rally throughout November (+ 12.2%) as fears of Dubai Government backed entities defaulting sparked a return by investors to safe-havens. Base metal prices experienced mixed results. Slower Chinese demand growth for nickel and steel has seen these prices fall from their August peaks.</p>
<p>The US dollar continued to slide during November, depreciating a further 1.2% on a trade-weighted basis &ndash; the Japanese yen continued to strengthen against the US dollar (increasing 5.4%). The Australian dollar remained at US$0.91, but depreciated 2.3% on a trade-weighted basis.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>The broad improvement in overseas and domestic economic indicators was maintained through October. However, the IMF remains cautious about global growth prospects &ndash; economic growth remains dependent upon government support and hasty withdrawal of this support may significantly dampen the global recovery.</p>
<p>In Australia, the Government&rsquo;s latest round of forecasts predicts stronger growth and smaller deficits than those presented in the Budget. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) anticipates growth close to the long-term trend and inflation close to their 2% to 3% target range over the next year. Consequently, the official cash rate, which is well below average - was again raised by 25bps to 3.25% in October. The latest data releases were mixed, although Australia&rsquo;s outlook remains positive. Consumer sentiment has risen sharply to lie above pre-crisis levels and residential housing approvals have increased.</p>
<p>Conditions in financial markets were mixed in October, with more volatility than has been seen in recent months. Share markets and bond yields reached new peaks for this cycle, but then fell in the latter part of the month. Global stock markets lost ground in October after posting solid gains in July, August and September. The MSCI World share price index fell by 2.1% reflecting falls in all the major markets &ndash; the US and UK fell 2%, Germany dropped 5% and Japan lost 1%. In Australia, early gains gave way to losses. The S&amp;P200 price index was up 6% at one stage but ended October 2.1% lower, with banking and mining stocks underperforming more defensive sectors such as healthcare and consumer staples.</p>
<p>The RBA&rsquo;s actions help push up the Australian 10-year bond yield further, increasing the yield spread over US 10-year bonds to 220 basis points. In corporate bond markets, credit risk premiums continued to fall, with riskier issuers improving the most.</p>
<p>Credit growth remained weak, albeit partly due to improved conditions in capital markets for borrowers. It remains clear that small and medium-size businesses are still experiencing difficulties in obtaining credit, as shown by the RBA Governor and Treasurer calling for banks to do more for commercial borrowers.</p>
<p>The Commodity Resource Bureau (CRB) index of world commodity prices rose 4.5% in October, as commodity markets proved to be more resilient than other markets. The oil price fluctuated between US$75/bbl and US$85/bbl, compared to a $65-$75/bbl range in the September quarter. The gold price increased by a further 4.2%, peaking just under US$1100/oz. Base metals were well supported &ndash; led by copper (+5%) and zinc (+10%) &ndash; despite signs of Chinese demand easing.</p>
<p>The downtrend in the US dollar continued in October, taking the cumulative decline since March 2009 to around 10%. By contrast, the Australian dollar gained another 3.7% in October on a trade-weighted basis &ndash; a cumulative appreciation of 30% since March 2009. The Australian dollar reached US$0.91, the highest level since July 2008.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>The global economic outlook continued to improve in September. The economic data confirmed that the recovery has extended to all the major economies, prompting the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to raise its forecasts for world economic growth. The IMF expects the global economy to contract by 1.1% in 2009 (0.3 percentage points less than previously forecast), but grow by 3.1% in 2010 (an upward revision of 0.6 percentage points).</p>
<p>A key question has been how Australia&rsquo;s economy would fare once the impact of Commonwealth cash handouts on retail sales fell away. The latest economic data provide reassurance and contributed to giving the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) sufficient comfort to raise its cash rate by 0.25% to 3.25% in early October. Major banks responded by raising their borrowing rates. Prices for interest rate futures indicate the RBA is expected to increase interest rates to 3.5% by the end of the year and to 5% by the end of 2010.</p>
<p>In September, the stock market rallied further. The MSCI world share price index rose by 3.3% in September, the US S&amp;P500 added 3.6% and the ASX200 gained 5.9% - a 7th successive gain for the local share market. In the September quarter, world markets gained 14.5% and the Australian market lifted 19.9%. Reflecting the improved conditions in financial markets, Banks were the strongest sector in the Australian market during the quarter (+35.6%), while mixed news on commodity prices caused Resources to lag (+11%).</p>
<p>The cost of wholesale funding has become less of an issue. In global and domestic capital markets, borrowing costs for many corporate borrowers have reduced and risk premia have fallen back to normal levels in some key markets. Moody&rsquo;s expects global speculative grade (junk bond) defaults to rise from 11.5% in August to a peak of 12.6% in the December quarter of 2009.</p>
<p>The Commodity Resource Bureau (CRB) index of world commodity prices slipped 2.4% in September, but ended the quarter 3.2% higher overall. Industrial metals prices wavered in the face of signs of Chinese demand easing, albeit after a strong run: the copper price fell by 4.9% during September and the nickel price dropped by 6.6%. The oil price continued to oscillate between US$65/bbl and US$75/bbl as it had done for most of the quarter. The gold price increased by 5.1% to US$1002/oz in September, then pushed higher in early October to break the US$1040/oz level for the first time.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar remained well supported, ending September at US$0.88, equivalent to a 5.4% appreciation for the month and an 8.6% gain for the quarter. On a trade-weighted basis, the Australian dollar gained 2.9% in September and 5.4% for the quarter.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>During August, global economic data suggested that the advanced economies were starting to expand, after experiencing a deep recession in late 2008 and early 2009. In the US, there has been improvement in key measures of business and consumer confidence over recent months, along with signs that the housing market has bottomed. Emerging market economies, which generally outperformed the advanced economies during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), continued to expand in August.</p>
<p>Global stock markets continued the rally that began in early March 2009, reflecting factors such as improving economic data, better earnings outcomes, falling credit spreads and less risk aversion by investors. The US S&amp;P 500 total return index rose by 3.6% in August, with the Financials (12.9%) and Industrials (4.1%) sectors experiencing the strongest gains. The more defensive sectors such as Utilities (0.2%) and Telecommunications (-2.4%) continued to underperform. In general, the stocks that fell the most during the GFC have rebounded the most during the rally over recent months. During August, the Australian equity market continued to rise sharply, with the S&amp;P/ASX 200 price index increasing by 5.5%.</p>
<p>While global stocks markets performed well in August, at times investors showed some concern about the sharp fall in Chinese stocks. After increasing by more than 100% since early November 2008, the Shanghai share price index fell by 21.8% in August, reflecting concerns that Chinese authorities may need to slow the economy.</p>
<p>During August, Chinese authorities expressed concern that &ndash; due to the huge fiscal stimulus and credit expansion &ndash; some sectors of the economy may be overheating. Chinese industrial production rose by 10.8% over the year to June&nbsp;&nbsp; production of cars is up by 55.2%, cement production is up by 21.6% and steel production is up by 19.4%. China&rsquo;s domestic credit growth posted a large gain of 33.9% over the year to July.</p>
<p>Australian economic data was generally stronger than expected and as a result the consensus forecasts for Australian GDP growth over the near term have increased. The June quarter GDP data exceeded consensus expectations, with output growth expanding by 0.6% in the quarter to be 0.6% higher than a year earlier. The result reaffirms Australia&rsquo;s relative economic success compared to other developed nations during the current downturn.</p>
<p>Economic conditions in Australia have improved sufficiently for the futures market to price in a high probability of at least one interest rate hike before the end of the year. However, the major central banks are expected to wait until well into 2010 before starting to raise interest rates. Bond yields fell modestly in August &ndash; this was surprising given the developments in other markets &ndash; and credit spreads continued to narrow.</p>
<p>During August, commodity prices continued to rise, led by industrial metals. The Commodity Research Bureau index of global commodity prices gained 3.7%. The oil price finished the month near where it started at US$70/bbl. The Japanese yen was the strongest of the major currencies during August and the Australian dollar rose to US$0.84, a gain of 1%.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Markets performed strongly in July as ongoing improvements in a number of global economic indicators underpinned rising investor confidence.&nbsp; While recent information suggests that the global economy is still contracting, the rate of contraction has moderated considerably, with leading indicators consistent with a return to growth before the end of 2009. Importantly, the rate of improvement has been faster than the consensus expected. The Australian economy also appears to have improved meaningfully over recent months. As risk aversion measures across both equity and credit markets continued to decline, investor focus shifted to countries and sectors leveraged to the improving macro environment.</p>
<p>In early March 2009, global equity markets were pricing a meaningful probability of the global economy experiencing a depression. Since that time, the likelihood of a depression has diminished and investors are increasingly focusing on the length and duration of the recovery phase. While equity markets have lifted accordingly, the rally in emerging markets has been roughly double that experienced in the developed world. This reflects the fact that the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) was largely a developed world crisis, with the financial systems of most emerging market countries only temporarily affected. In addition, the large fiscal and monetary stimulus in China that was announced in November 2008 has quickly restored a strong rate of growth in the Chinese economy, which has boosted many of the emerging market economies and also Australia.</p>
<p>The rebound in the US Institute of Supply Management manufacturing index (ISM), which is a key indicator of economic growth, continued to improve in July with the ISM readings for new orders and production rising to their highest levels in two years. Investors also took comfort from US New Home Sales data in the month of July, which were stronger than expected, rising by 11% in the month, the strongest monthly rise since December 2000.</p>
<p>In July, the US Federal Reserve left the Federal Funds rate target range unchanged at 0 to 0.25 percent. In the UK, The Bank of England also left its key policy rate unchanged at 0.50%. Domestically, the RBA decided to leave cash rates unchanged at 3.0%, at its July and August meetings.</p>
<p>While the Australian economy has been adversely affected by the GFC, its impact has been less acute. There is growing evidence that the Australian economy is starting to expand again, with the housing sector particularly buoyant.&nbsp; Consumer confidence as measured by the Westpac/Melbourne Institute Index has surged to near two-year highs in August as hopes for a quick economic rebound emerged.&nbsp; The index of consumer sentiment rose 3.7% in August, which is a rise of 27.8% since May, its largest three-month gain since the survey began in 1975, and has now risen 43.6% from its 2008 trough. The combination of these conditions have recently prompted Glenn Stevens (the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia) to start suggesting that the cash rate may need to need to rise from the current low level of 3.0% at some stage in the next 12 months or so.</p>
<p>In the US, the stronger market sentiment in July helped lift the S&amp;P500 by 8.6% for the month, which concluded the best five month positive streak since 1938. In the UK, the FTSE index also rose a similar amount for the month.&nbsp; While, as at the end of July 2009, the Hang Seng (Hong Kong) and Nikkei (Japan) were back to levels not seen since September/October 2008 respectively. In Australia, the S&amp;P/ASX 200 index finished the month 7.3% higher, its highest level since October/November 2008. Reflecting the increase in risk appetite, the Industrial, Material and Consumer Discretionary sectors outperformed strongly, whereas investors continued to reduce exposure to Healthcare, a relatively defensive sector.</p>
<p>In government bond markets, despite the improving sentiment toward global economic recovery and the rise in investor risk appetite, the yield on the 10 year US Treasury note fell to 3.48% as at the end of July (a fall of 6 basis points for the month). Meanwhile, Australian 10 year bond yields edged higher, finishing the month at 5.60% a rise of 8 basis points over the month of July.</p>
<p>The strong economic newsflow from China boosted both sentiment and prices in commodity markets during the month with significant increases in July for metals such as nickel (+13.6%), lead (+14.0%) and copper (+12.6%). Gold finished the month broadly unchanged as reduced risk aversion saw investors move into recovery orientated opportunities. Oil finished the month slightly down (-0.6% to $69.45/bbl) as destocking concerns negated expectations for a rise in oil demand flowing from economic recovery.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>The rally in financial markets lost momentum in June as hope faded for the global economy making a swift transition from stabilisation to sustained upswing. News about the state of the global economy was mixed, illustrated by seemingly conflicting revisions to &lsquo;official&rsquo; growth forecasts by the World Bank (down) and OECD and IMF (up). In Australia, data releases mostly confirmed that the domestic economy is proving resilient.</p>
<p>Prices for riskier asset classes fell towards the end of June and into early July, as questions surrounding the sustainability of the economic recovery resulted in a preference for safer investments such as government bonds. The lack of a clear upswing in economic activity, combined with rising prices, has diminished incentives for buyers as they are indicative of lower future returns.</p>
<p>The RBA saw no need to reduce the official interest rate below 3% at either its June or July meeting, noting signs of stabilisation in the economy and that the effects of past easings have yet to be observed. Fewer central banks overseas cut rates than in recent months, increasingly turning to alternative stimulatory measures, such as buying government bonds and high-rated corporate debt, as rates reach historic lows.</p>
<p>In government bond markets, yields rose further as concerns about the threat of deflation eased. US 10-year Treasury note yields gained 7 basis points, ending the month at 3.53%. Australian 10-year bond yields rose 24 basis points to 5.52% in June as the RBA minutes provided stronger indication that the cycle of interest rate cuts was at an end.</p>
<p>Global stock markets fell 0.2% in the month, but posted their first quarterly gain (16.3%) since September 2007. Emerging markets share prices fell 1.5% for the month, with marked variation between countries, for example the Chinese market gained 12% and the Indian market lost 1%. Developed markets dropped just 0.2%. The S&amp;P500 was flat, while the Australian market outperformed the average, with the ASX200 gaining 3.6%.</p>
<p>For the June quarter, Australian share prices rose 10%. The better economic news and a number of successful capital raisings contributed to the market-leading performance of consumer discretionary, real estate investment trusts and industrials. Resource stocks outperformed non-resource stocks in the first half of 2009.</p>
<p>Commodity prices were mixed in June. The price of gold eased 2.3%. The oil price (West Texas Intermediate) rose 5.4% while the price of natural gas dropped 6.6%. Nickel gained 16.3% for the month and 70.2% for the June quarter &ndash; although still ended the financial year down 39.3% &ndash; while copper gained 5.8%.&nbsp; Wheat prices improved 18.2%. Iron ore prices fell, with Rio Tinto accepting a 33% cut in the price paid by Japanese steelmakers for iron ore. The CRB index of world commodity prices increased 0.6% for June, and 13.6% for the quarter.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar consolidated in June, trading between US$0.785 and US$0.815. In the June quarter, the A$ rose from US$0.69 to US$0.81 and the TWI rose from 57.4 to 64.7.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Global financial markets extended their rallies in May, with positive news on the state of the global economy. There were tentative signs that the worst of the global economic downturn may have occurred and some green shoots of recovery continued to emerge. In Australia, May data releases on unemployment showed a surprisingly high result, while GDP growth figures released in early June showed a positive result for the March quarter, remaining substantially better than other developed nations. However, there was also some bad news, including the filing for bankruptcy by General Motors, suggesting there remains a need for caution.</p>
<p>The Federal Budget in Australia showed a marked deterioration in the financial position, with large stimulatory expenditure and reduction in taxation revenue. Net debt is expected rise to around by 14% of GDP by 2012-13, although this still is low by developed world standards.</p>
<p>Reflecting the stimulatory impact of the Budget and signs of improvement in the economy, the RBA left cash rates in Australia unchanged at 3%. Some overseas central banks continued to cut interest rates, although they are increasingly turning to alternative stimulatory measures as rates reach historic lows.</p>
<p>Overall, credit conditions remain challenging but have improved. In government bond markets, yields tended to rise in response to improvements in economic indicators and the end of concerns about the threat of deflation. US 10-year Treasury note yields gained 34 basis points, ending the month at 3.46%. Australian 10-year bond yields rose 71 basis points in May as the RBA minutes indicated that the cycle of interest rate cuts was nearing or at and end.</p>
<p>Global stock markets rose 6% in the month, adding to the gains of March (6.5%) and April (10%). Emerging markets jumped 12% for the month, outperforming developed markets which gained 5%. The S&amp;P 500 matched the developed market average, however Australian markets lagged, with the ASX200 gaining just 1%.</p>
<p>Commodity prices rose in May, with the price of gold advancing 8.6%.&nbsp; The oil price (West Texas Intermediate) rose 29.7% while the price of natural gas gained 20.8%. Nickel gained 19.7% for the month &ndash; although is still down 47.8% for the financial year to date &ndash; while copper gained 5.8%.&nbsp; Wheat prices improved 18.2%. Iron ore prices fell, with Rio Tinto accepting a 33% cut in the price paid by Japanese steelmakers. The Commodity Research Bureau index of commodity prices increased by 7.0% in May.</p>
<p>The rapid rebound of the Australian dollar continued, rising from US73c to US81c in May, or 10.5%, although this was partially due to a weaker US dollar, which was down 6.6% on a trade-weighted basis. The Australian dollar improved 6.0% on a trade-weighted basis, and by 6.4% against the Yen.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Tentative signs that the worst of the global economic downturn may have occurred continued to emerge in April.&nbsp; Risk aversion decreased in the face of fresh signs from the major economies that the recession and financial crisis may be receding.&nbsp; In Australia, data releases in early May for retail sales and unemployment in Australia for April were surprisingly healthy.&nbsp; However, gloomy new forecasts from the IMF and some further bad news such as the filing for bankruptcy by Chrysler, served as a reminder that there is still reason for caution.</p>
<p>Governments further extended stimulatory measures in April, including Australia where tax bonuses were rolled out, and the G20 nations which promised additional support.&nbsp; Central banks variously continued to cut official cash rates, albeit at a slower pace than in recent months, as well as using other stimulatory measures.&nbsp; In early April, the RBA cut the cash rate by 25 basis points to 3%, the lowest level since 1960 and the ECB also cut by 25 bps to 1.25%.&nbsp; While the Bank of England, announced a programme of asset purchases to be financed by the issuance of central bank reserves.</p>
<p>Financial markets reflected the improved sentiment.&nbsp; Overall, credit conditions remain challenging, but have improved.&nbsp; In government bond markets, yields tended to rise as the mood in financial markets lightened.&nbsp; US 10-year Treasury note yields gained 44 basis points, ending the month at 3.12%.&nbsp; Australian 10-year bond yields rose 16 basis points in April, as the RBA minutes indicated that the cycle of interest rate cuts was nearing or at an end.</p>
<p>Global stock markets rose 10% in the month, although they still are down 41% for the financial year to date.&nbsp; By the end of April, the S&amp;P500 and the ASX200 neared 2009 highs.</p>
<p>Increased appetite for risk was evident in base metal prices, however commodities more generally were mixed.&nbsp; The price of gold &ndash; often a safe haven during times of stress &ndash; fell a further 3.5% in April.&nbsp; The oil price (West Texas Intermediate) rose 2.9% but the price of natural gas was down 10%.&nbsp; Nickel gained 22.3% for the month &ndash; although is still down 56.4% for the financial year to date &ndash; while copper gained 11.9% and aluminium 4.8%.&nbsp; The CRB index of commodity prices increased by 5.5% for the month.</p>
<p>In currency markets, the Australian dollar continued to recover recently lost ground and finished the month up 4% on a trade weighted-basis.&nbsp; The Australian dollar gained 5% against the US dollar and 6.4% against the Yen, making gains against all the major developed currencies.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>There were tentative signs that the worst of the global economic downturn may have occurred in the December and March quarters. In many countries, key economic indicators of consumer and business confidence and business conditions have stopped falling or risen moderately off their lows. While the developed world economy is still contracting, the pace of contraction has slowed. Importantly, consumer spending appears to have stabilised and businesses have made large inroads into surplus stock. However, gloomy new forecasts from the OECD served as a reminder that the recovery phase may stretch beyond 2010.</p>
<p>The raft of monetary and fiscal policy measures enacted to date have underpinned improving financial conditions and are helping economies to regain traction. Governments extended these measures further in March and early April and the G20 nations promised additional support, especially for trade and developing countries. Central banks variously continued to cut official cash rates and bought government and highly-rated corporate bonds to bring down longer-term market interest rates. In early April, the RBA cut the cash rate by 25 basis points to 3%, the lowest level since 1960 and the ECB also cut by 25 bps to 1.25%.</p>
<p>Financial markets reflected the improved sentiment. Overall, credit conditions continued to improve although bond risk premiums for less creditworthy corporate borrowers increased a little. In government bond markets, yields tended to rise as the mood in financial markets lightened. US 10-year Treasury note yields dropped 50 basis points after the Federal Reserve said it would buy government bonds, ending the month at 2.66%, 35 basis points below where they started. Australian 10-year bond yields rose 2 basis points in March and the yield spread over US bonds jumped to 1.76%.</p>
<p>Global stock markets rose 6% in the month, although they still are down 9% for the quarter. After recording multi-year lows early in the month, the S&amp;P500 and the ASX200 surged by 20% and 14% respectively through the rest of March.</p>
<p>Signs of a quick turnaround in Chinese economic indicators and increased demand for raw materials boosted prices of commodity producers. Many of the 20 best performed stocks in the ASX200 in the March quarter were commodity producers, including the likes of Dominion Mining, Riversdale Mining, Eastern Star Gas, Rio Tinto, Fortescue Metals and Gloucester Coal.</p>
<p>Increased appetite for risk was evident in commodity markets too. The price of gold &ndash; often a safe haven during times of stress &ndash; fell 3% in March, but prices of platinum and palladium &ndash; precious metals used primarily in industry &ndash; rose by 6% and 9% respectively. The oil price (West Texas Intermediate) rose 11% and speculative futures positions traded on the NYMEX exchange rose back above levels prevailing immediately before the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. Copper gained 17% in the month and 32% in the March quarter, having fallen 65% in the preceding 2 quarters. The CRB index of commodity prices increased by 3%.</p>
<p>In currency markets, the Australian and New Zealand dollars appreciated against most other currencies and the Japanese yen depreciated.&nbsp; The Australian dollar rose 5% on a trade-weighted basis, 8% against the US dollar and 9% against the yen. The New Zealand dollar gained 14% against the US dollar.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Prime Super participated in a consortium which purchased a Chilean gas distribution company, GasValpo, in April 2008. Prime Super&rsquo;s investment in GasValpo has exceeded expectations largely due to two factors: the subsequent bolt-on acquisition of GasValpo&rsquo;s major competitor, Energas, in November 2008 at a very attractive price; and because the company has successfully negotiated excellent new gas supply contracts which ensure that the combined business will have access to competitively priced natural gas supplies over the long term.</p>
<p>While the economic environment has deteriorated since the original acquisition (although the Chilean economy has shown a much better resilience than many developed economies so far), management has been able to implement value-added strategies that have mitigated risks to profit margins. These strategies include renegotiating the terms of the gas transportation contracts, entering into gas swap agreements with ENAP (Chile&rsquo;s biggest oil company) and raising customer tariffs. It is important to highlight that even though customer tariffs have increased substantially, GasValpo has not reported material customer losses.</p>
<p>Prime Super&rsquo;s investment in GasValpo could continue to surprise on the upside with a number of joint venture and customer growth opportunities currently being explored.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>In January, there was an increase in investor risk aversion reflecting concerns about the global economy. It remains unclear how deep the current global economic downturn will be, with many forecasts of the timing of any recovery pushed back over recent months. The fallout of the credit crisis is extending, with more government bailouts and stimulus packages introduced in many countries over recent months.</p>
<p>The global financial system remained under &ldquo;intense stress&rdquo; in January, according to the International Monetary Fund.&nbsp; Data releases both locally and internationally were still weak. For example, the US economy lost more than 500,000 jobs in each of December and January.</p>
<p>In Australia, further evidence of significantly slowing domestic demand emerged, with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) noting that demand was slowing more rapidly than anticipated. The RBA cut rates by 100 basis points in early February. The cash rate is now 3.25%, with mortgage rates having fallen to their lowest level since the 1970s.&nbsp; In addition to the RBA cutting rates in January, the Australian government announced a $42 billion stimulus plan.</p>
<p>Developed equity markets were mixed, with weak profit reports, particularly in the financial sector, increasing volatility.&nbsp; Overall, the MSCI Developed Markets World Index fell by 7.2% in January. Emerging markets were also weak, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index dropping by 3.1%.</p>
<p>In January, the US equity market fell sharply, with the S&amp;P 500 falling by 8.6%, after some improvement in December. While the US equity market fell sharply, the Japanese Nikkei held up well (gaining 4.1%) and the UK FTSE 100 gained 3.4%. India&rsquo;s Sensex Index gained 6.1%, while the Brazilian Bovespa rose 2.6%. The Shanghai 180 was flat, while the Russian Trading System Index continued its weak run, losing 6.7%. In Australia, the S&amp;P/ASX 300 fell by 4.9%, with greater losses for the listed property trust sector, which fell by 9.6%.</p>
<p>While there has been some improvement in credit conditions over recent months, credit spreads remain very high. In January, global bond yields generally increased reflecting investor concerns about the likely magnitude of bond issuance required to fund aggressive fiscal stimulus packages in many parts of the world. The G7 average bond yield moved up 41 basis points in January.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar fell in January, reflecting factors such as reliance on foreign capital, weaker commodity prices and a narrowing interest rate differential to the rest of the world. The Australian dollar was down against the US dollar (-7.2%). Despite weakness in the US economy, the appreciation of the US dollar continued, ending January up against the Euro (8.6%), but down very slightly against the Yen (-0.7%).</p>
<p>Commodity prices were mixed in January, with gold gaining 6.5%, while the oil price fell by 6.5%. Base metals had a weaker month, with aluminium, zinc and steel prices all down by more than 5%. Yet, overall, the Commodity Research Bureau index of commodity prices finished 1.1% higher in January.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Markets calmed somewhat in December after several months of volatility. The fallout of the credit crunch is extending, with much attention in December focused on negotiations to bail out the US automotive industry. Major developed economies moved further into recession, while data indicated that growth slowed in many developing countries.</p>
<p>Data releases both locally and internationally were weak. The US Federal Reserve (the Fed) took the step of reducing the cash rate to effectively zero, targeting a range of 0% to 0.25%. The Fed now is relying on expanding its balance sheet to fight the economic slowdown.</p>
<p>In Australia, further evidence of significantly slowing domestic demand emerged, with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) noting that demand was slowing more rapidly than anticipated. The RBA&rsquo;s concerns have shifted substantially towards growth, with 100 basis points cut from the cash rate in early December. The cash rate now sits at 4.25%, with markets anticipating further smaller cuts in future months.</p>
<p>Developed equity markets enjoyed mixed fortunes, but overall were quite stable, with relatively thin trade during the holiday season. It is too early, however, to suggest that this improved stability reflects any longer-term recovery.&nbsp; Overall, the MSCI Developed Markets World Index gained 0.9% in December. Emerging markets were also stronger, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index surging 4.4%.</p>
<p>The US market moved off recent 5-year lows, with the S&amp;P 500 up 0.8%. Elsewhere, the ASX 300 finished down 0.4%, with property trusts struggling (down 12.2%). The Nikkei held up well, gaining 4.1%, and the FTSE 100 gained 3.4%.&nbsp; India&rsquo;s Sensex Index gained 6.1% as inflation looks to be easing, while the Brazilian Bovespa rose 2.6%. The Shanghai 180 was subdued, down 0.2%, while the Russian Trading System Index continued its weak run, losing 6.7%.</p>
<p>Bond yields moved lower as the economic outlook deteriorated in early December. Japanese bond yields ended down 23 basis points as interest rates were cut further, while US bond yields fell after the Fed interest rate cut decision, falling 71 basis points. European yields fell with those in the US, dropping 15 basis points for December, while rate cuts helped drive Australian 10-year Commonwealth bond yields down 59 basis points to 3.99%.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar was more solid in December, gaining 5.3% against the US dollar and 12.5% against the Sterling, while losing only a little ground against the Yen (-0.3%) and Euro (-2.3%). Overall, the currency gained 1.8% on a trade-weighted basis. The US dollar fell on the back of gloomy US economic data, ending December down against the Yen (-5.0%) and Euro (-10.0%) and up against the Sterling (5.1%) to be down 4.4% on a trade-weighted basis.</p>
<p>Commodity prices were mostly lower in December, as concerns about slowing global growth continued to affect commodity markets. Precious metals bucked the trend, with gold up 6.1% and silver up 6.6%. Base metals were lower and the London Metal Exchange Index lost 16.4%, with copper (-19.0%) and aluminium (-14.5%) suffering from significant oversupply. Nickel made gains (+11.4%) after major mines and projects were cancelled in November. Gas dropped 16.1% while West Texas Intermediate Oil continues to slide, falling 10.4%. Overall, the CRB index of commodity prices finished 2.4% lower in December.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Markets remained unsettled in November. The fallout of the credit crunch extended into the broader global economy, pushing some high-profile non-financial firms towards bankruptcy or into administration, including the Big 3 US car makers, UK retailer Woolworths and Australian child-care operator ABC Learning. Economic data released during the month confirmed the major developed economies are in recession.</p>
<p>In Australia, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) noted that demand was slowing more rapidly than anticipated. RBA concerns have shifted substantially towards growth, with a 75 basis point cut from the cash rate in early November and a further 100 basis point cut in early December. The cash rate now sits at 4.25%, with markets anticipating further smaller cuts in future months.</p>
<p>Developed equity markets were weaker, with significant intra-month and even intra-day volatility, although the final week of November was one of the best ever, with the single largest weekly percentage gain on record in Australia. A raft of new support measures announced by central banks and governments underpinned the rebound. Overall, the MSCI Developed Markets World Index fell 6.3% in November. Emerging markets were also weaker, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index falling 4.1%.</p>
<p>The US market moved further below recent 5-year lows, with the S&amp;P 500 down 7.5%. Elsewhere, the S&amp;P/ASX 300 finished down 6.9%, with IT stocks down 18%. The Nikkei fell only 0.8% even in spite of poor company results and the Japanese economy moving into recession. India&rsquo;s Sensex Index dropped 7.1%, while the Brazilian Bovespa lost 1.8%.&nbsp; The Shanghai 180 gained 8% as the authorities announced a large stimulus package to support growth.</p>
<p>Bond yields moved lower as economic growth expectations were downgraded in November. Japanese bond yields ended down 7 basis points, while US bond yields plunged 102 basis points. European yields fell 63 basis points as interest rates are expected to fall more rapidly now that inflation is declining, while rate cut speculation drove Australian 10-year Commonwealth bond yields down 60 basis points to 4.58%.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar steadied somewhat in November, falling only 0.2% on a trade-weighted basis. The Australian dollar lost 0.7% against the US dollar and was down against the Yen (-2.9%) and Euro (-1.6%), however it rose against the Sterling (3.8%). The US dollar rose against the Sterling (5.0%), but slipped against the Euro (-0.9%), and fell further against the &lsquo;safe haven&rsquo; Yen (-2.2%).</p>
<p>Commodity prices slumped further in November, as concerns about slowing global growth continued to affect demand.&nbsp; Base metals were lower, with copper (-10.3%), aluminium (-13.7%) and nickel (-14.2%) falling as demand declines and inventories are increasing, with more projects now being cancelled.

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>October was the worst month of the credit crisis so far. Disruptions in key interbank and commercial paper markets prompted further emergency policy actions, while several countries turned to the IMF for assistance. An increasing number of major developed economies moved towards recession, while key emerging market economies continued to slow.</p>
<p>The US Federal Reserve cut rates twice in October, by 50 basis points each time. The first change was in concert with European and the Canadian central banks in an effort to ease liquidity constraints in wholesale money markets.</p>
<p>In Australia, further evidence of significantly slowing domestic demand emerged, with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) noting that demand was slowing more rapidly than anticipated. Despite ongoing high inflation, the RBA&rsquo;s concerns have shifted substantially towards growth, leading to a 100 basis point cut in early October, the largest single cut since 1992, followed by a further 75 basis point in early November. The cash rate is now 5.25%, with markets anticipating further cuts over coming months.</p>
<p>Developed equity markets were weaker in October, with significant intra-month and intra-day volatility. Performance of equity markets in October showed that the &lsquo;credit crunch&rsquo; still has some way to run, with the impacts now moving to the &lsquo;real&rsquo; economy. Overall, the MSCI Developed Markets World Index fell by 16.5% in October. Emerging markets also performed poorly, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index falling by 22.5%.</p>
<p>The US market had a very weak October, with the S&amp;P 500 falling 16.9%. Elsewhere, the ASX 300 finished down 12.9%, with property trusts losing a quarter of their value. The European Stoxx was down 15.9%, while the Nikkei fell 23.8% as the Japanese economy continued to move towards recession. India&rsquo;s Sensex Index dropped 23.9%, while the Brazilian Bovespa lost 24.8%. The Shanghai 180 lost another 26.2% as concerns about growth prospects increased. The Russian Trading System Index continued its weak run, plunging 32.1%.</p>
<p>Japanese bond yields ended unchanged after late falls following the interest rate cut, while US bond yields ended October up 16 basis points with concerns about the inflationary effects of fiscal policy increasing. European yields fell 3 basis points, while rate cut speculation and a higher than anticipated cut in the cash rate in October drove Australian 10-year Commonwealth bond yields down 19 basis points to 5.18%.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar crashed, falling 16.1% against the US$. The Australian dollar was down against the Yen (-20.8%), the Euro (-7.9%) and Sterling (-8.4%), as well as on a trade-weighted basis (-13.7%). The US dollar rose as foreign growth forecasts fell and risk aversion increased, ending October up against the Euro (9.8%), and Sterling (9.9%), but down against the &lsquo;safe haven&rsquo; Yen (-7.1%).</p>
<p>Commodity prices were universally weaker in October, reflecting concerns about slowing global growth. Even the &lsquo;safe haven&rsquo; commodity gold fell 17.0%. Base metals were lower, with copper (-37.8%), aluminium (-17.7%) and nickel (-28.2%) falling as demand declined and inventories increased. The London Metal Exchange Index slumped 26.8%, gas dropped 14.4% and West Texas Intermediate Oil crashed 32.6%. Overall, the CRB index of commodity prices finished 16.8% lower in October.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>During September, credit concerns increased as major financial institutions in the US and Europe failed. These concerns, combined with heightened fears about global economic growth, resulted in investors becoming risk averse, with global equity markets falling sharply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data releases both locally and internationally showed economic conditions deteriorating &ndash; the major developed countries appear to be in recession and growth in key emerging markets is deteriorating. In early October, the Fed cut rates 50bps in concert with some of the other major central banks in an effort to ease liquidity constraints in wholesale money markets and in anticipation of an economic slowdown.</p>
<p>In Australia, further evidence of slowing domestic demand emerged. Despite ongoing high inflation, the RBA&rsquo;s concerns have shifted substantially towards growth, leading to a 25 basis point cut in the cash rate in early September and a 100 basis point cut in early October, the largest single cut since 1992. The cash rate now sits at 6.0%, with markets anticipating further cuts in future months.</p>
<p>Developed equity markets were weaker in September, with significant downward moves after the failure of Lehman Brothers and the initial rejection of the US Government&rsquo;s rescue plan. Overall, the MSCI Developed Markets World Index fell 11.0% in September. Emerging markets also performed poorly, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index falling 12.6%.</p>
<p>In the US, the S&amp;P 500 fell 9.1% in September. Locally, the ASX 300 had a poor month, finishing down 10.5%, with the materials sector leading the falls reflecting expectations of weak global growth and investors fleeing from asset classes perceived as risky. The European Stoxx fell 11.5%, while the Nikkei fell 13.9% as the Japanese economy contracted in the June quarter 2008. India&rsquo;s Sensex Index dropped 11.7% on the international lead, while the Brazilian Bovespa lost 11.0% on the back of weaker commodity prices. The Shanghai 180 lost another 7.0% in September, although it was one of the better performers. The Russian Trading System Index plunged 23.8% due to lower commodity prices.</p>
<p>Events on international financial markets ensured significant intra-month volatility in bond yields, although the overall yields were relatively stable in most markets. Japanese bond yields rose 6 basis points, while US bond yields fell steadily before surging on the 19th after the Federal Reserve introduced new emergency measures, ending September down 1 basis point. European yields moved with US yields, ending September down 6 basis points. Rate cute speculation drove the Australian 10-year Commonwealth bond yield down 35 basis points to 5.40%.</p>
<p>Commodity prices were mostly weaker in September, as concerns about slowing global growth continued to affect commodity markets.&nbsp; Base metals were lower, with copper (-14.5%), aluminium (-10.7%) and nickel (-22.3%) recording large falls. Energy prices fell, including gas (-12.3%) and West Texas Intermediate oil (-13.2%).&nbsp; Precious metals were the best performers, with gold up 5.2% and silver down 5.8%. Overall, the CRB index of commodity prices finished 6.0% lower in September.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar fell sharply and appeared to be a victim of local banks having their access to offshore borrowing restricted - falling 7.5% against the US dollar, 12.3% against the Yen and 4.2% versus the Euro, and 6.4% on a trade-weighted basis. The US dollar rose as foreign growth forecasts fell and risk aversion increased, ending September up against the Euro (3.8%) and Sterling (2.1%), but down against the &lsquo;safe haven&rsquo; Yen (-2.6%).</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Financial markets were less volatile in August. Credit concerns persisted and there were heightened worries about the slowdown in global economic growth, which affected commodities in particular.</p>
<p>US data were still weak and the consensus now expects several quarters of low to moderate growth. The Fed left rates unchanged at 2.0% in August, while in the other major economies, central bankers are shifting their focus from rising inflation to slowing activity. Japan, the UK and ECB also left rates unchanged.</p>
<p>In Australia, further evidence of slowing domestic demand emerged. Despite ongoing high inflation, RBA concerns are now shifting to growth, leading to a 25bps cut in the cash rate in early September, with markets anticipating further cuts in future months.</p>
<p>Developed equity markets generally performed well, showing less volatility within the month. Most markets recorded modest gains. Performance of equity markets in August suggested that, although there are more aftershocks of the &lsquo;credit crunch&rsquo; yet to be felt, markets may be steadying. Overall, the MSCI Developed Markets World Index rose 1.0% in August.&nbsp; Emerging markets generally performed poorly, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index falling 5.1%</p>
<p>The US market steadied throughout August, with the S&amp;P 500 up 1.2% over the month. Elsewhere, the ASX 300 had a good month, finishing up 3.1% even in spite of the poor performance in commodity prices. The European Stoxx was up 1.1%, while the Nikkei fell 2.3% as the Bank of Japan again revised its economic assessment downward. India&rsquo;s Sensex Index gained 1.5% as new mining projects propelled the market, while the Brazilian Bovespa lost 6.4% on the back of weaker commodity prices. The Shanghai 180 lost another 13.4% in August and is now down 58% compared to its peak in October 2007.&nbsp; The Russian Trading System Index plunged 15.5% due to lower commodity prices and concerns over the Georgian conflict.</p>
<p>Shifts in expectations about the future direction in official interest rates and signs of inflation easing influenced movements in bond yields for August. Japanese bond yields fell 12bps as warnings about slowing growth continued.&nbsp; US bond yields fell steadily after the Fed left rates unchanged, ending August down 18bps. European yields fall 23bps as data revealed that the Euro-zone contracted in the June quarter. Rate cute speculation drove Australian 10-year Commonwealth bond yields down 48bps to 5.75%</p>
<p>The A$ crashed with the commodity prices that had supported it, falling 8.8% against the US$. The A$ was also hindered by interest rate expectations, down against the Yen (-7.4%), the Euro (-3.1%) and Sterling (-0.6%), as well as on a trade-weighted basis (-6.2%).&nbsp; The US$ rose as foreign growth forecasts fell, ending August up against the Yen (0.9%), Euro (5.9%), and Sterling (8.2%).</p>
<p>Commodity prices were mostly weaker in August, as concerns about slowing global growth continued to affect commodity markets. Precious metals fell sharply, with gold and silver down 9.0% and 21.3% respectively. Base metals were mostly lower, with copper (-9.1%) and aluminium (8.4%) recording large falls, although nickel gained 8.8% as Xstrata announced it was suspending operations in the Dominican Republic. The end of July saw the London Metal Exchange Index down 6.1%, gas down 10.9% and West Texas Intermediate Oil down 6.5%. Overall, the CRB index of commodity prices finished 4.3% lower in August.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Financial markets were mostly weaker in July due to ongoing concerns about credit problems and heightened concerns about the slowdown in global economic growth.</p>
<p>US data were still weak and the consensus now expects several quarters of low to moderate growth. The Fed left rates unchanged at 2.0% in August, emphasising inflationary concerns and providing further evidence for markets that the US rate cutting cycle has now ended. In the other major economies, central bankers are shifting their focus from rising inflation to slowing activity. Japan and the UK left rates unchanged in June, however the European Central Bank increased official rates by 25bps in early July, as did a number of Asian central banks.</p>
<p>In Australia, further evidence of slowing domestic demand emerged. Despite ongoing high inflation, RBA concerns are now shifting to growth and markets are now expecting rates to be cut from September.</p>
<p>Equity markets were mixed in July, with most markets performing poorly in the first half of the month before recovering to have a stronger second half as oil prices eased. Performance of equity markets in July suggested that there are more aftershocks of the &lsquo;credit crunch&rsquo; yet to be felt. Overall, the MSCI Developed Markets World Index fell 1.9% in July, with Germany and Hong Kong among the few markets to record gains, whilst emerging markets as a whole had a worse month, down 5.5%.</p>
<p>The US market steadied after early falls, with the S&amp;P 500 down 1.0% over the month. Elsewhere, the ASX 200 had a weak month, finishing down 4.6% with energy stocks crashing 13.7% on the back of weaker commodity prices, while the European Stoxx was down 1.8%. In Asia, the Shanghai 180 rose 0.5% for July. The Hang Seng finished up 2.8%, while the Nikkei fell 0.8%. India&rsquo;s Sensex Index was a strong performer in spite of interest rate hikes, up 6.6% while the Brazilian Bovespa took another tumble, down 9.2% for July.</p>
<p>Shifts in expectations about the future direction in interest rates dictated movements in bond yields for July. Japanese bond yields fell as warnings about slowing growth continued, down 6bps overall. US bond yields rose early as markets expected a rate hike, then fell as this looked unlikely, ending July unchanged. Indications that July&rsquo;s rate hike by the ECB was a one-off saw European yields fall 23bps. Australian 10-year Commonwealth bond yields were driven downwards as speculation of a future rate cute increased, ending the month down 22bps at 6.23%.</p>
<p>The A$ had a weak performance in July, falling 1.8% against the US$, partly reflecting the increased likelihood of the RBA cutting interest rates soon. The A$ was also down 0.3% against the Yen, and also fell against the Euro (-1.0%) and Sterling (-1.6%), ending down 1.6% on a trade weighted basis. The US$ rose as oil prices eased, ending July up against the Yen (1.7%), Euro (1.0%), and Sterling (0.5%).</p>
<p>Commodity prices were universally weaker in July, as concerns about slowing global growth filtered through to commodity markets. Precious metals fell in July, with gold and silver down 0.6% and 1.0% respectively. Base metals were also lower, with copper down 5.9% as Peruvian strikes ended, while the nickel price fell 14.0% with weaker stainless steel production in China lowering demand. The end of July saw the Economist Base Metals Index down 0.4%, gas down 29.6% and the price of West Texas Intermediate Oil down 11.4%. Overall, the CRB index of commodity prices finished 3.7% lower in July.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Financial markets took an other fall in June, as concerns about credit problems again arose and economic growth forecasts were downgraded.</p>
<p>US data were still weak and the consensus now expects several quarters of low to moderate growth. The Fed left rates unchanged at 2.0% in June, emphasising inflationary concerns. Markets believe the US rate cutting cycle has now ended.&nbsp; In the other major economies, central bankers are increasingly shifting their focus from concern over uncertainty in global financial markets towards rising inflation. Japan and the UK left rates unchanged in June, however the European Central Bank increased official rates by 25bps in early July, as did a number of Asian central banks.<br />In Australia, further evidence of slowing domestic demand emerged. Although inflation, currently at 4.2%, is running at a higher rate than the RBA would like, the Bank believes that it should decline over time if demand moderates as is currently expected, leading to rates being left unchanged in June and July.</p>
<p>Equity markets were down in June. Performance of equity markets in June suggested that beliefs that the low point of the &lsquo;credit crunch&rsquo; had been reached may be erroneous and the share prices may yet have further to fall before the recovery begins. Overall, the MSCI Developed Markets World Index fell 8.4% in June, with Germany and Hong Kong among the weakest performers, whilst emerging markets as a whole had an even worse month, down 10.1%.</p>
<p>The US market fell steadily throughout June, with the S&amp;P 500 down 8.6% over the month. Elsewhere, the ASX 200 finished down 7.8% with energy the sole sector to record gains, while the European Stoxx was down 11.1%. In Asia, the Shanghai 180 fell 22.6% for June after authorities unexpectedly raised the reserve requirements on deposits of banks.&nbsp; The Hang Seng finished down 9.9%, while the Nikkei fell 6.0% amidst the longest losing streak on the Nikkei since 1954. India&rsquo;s Sensex Index fell heavily, down 18.0% while the Brazilian Bovespa took a tumble after two months of record highs, down 10.4% for June.</p>
<p>The sell off in equities saw money shift into bonds, leading to falling yields in most markets. Japanese bonds yields rose significantly early, before falling as the equity market losing streak took hold, down 16bps overall. US bond yields were less volatile overall, down 18bps. Australian 10-year Commonwealth bond yields were driven by unexpectedly high growth data and then the RBA Board minutes, which downplayed the case for further rate hikes, with yields ending the month down 8bps at 6.45%.</p>
<p>The $A had a mixed performance in June, rising 0.2% against the US$, with some forecasters suggesting parity against the US$ may occur for the first time since the currency was floated. The A$ was also up 1.3% against the Yen, however fell against the Euro (-0.7%) and Sterling (-0.1%), ending up 0.8% on a trade weighted basis. The US$ rose against the Yen (0.5%), however fell against the Euro (-1.3%), and Sterling (-0.6%).</p>
<p>Precious metals rose again in June, with gold and silver up 3.9% and 4.7% respectively. Results for base metals were mixed, with copper up 8.3% with strikes in Peru and forecast production deficit for 2008, however nickel fell 2.1%. The end of June saw the Economist Base Metals Index up 0.1%, gas up 14.2% and the price of West Texas Intermediate Oil up 9.9%. Overall, the CRB index of commodity prices finished 4.6% higher in June.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Financial markets were more settled in May, although concerns about credit problems, increased inflation and the ongoing effects of oil prices lingered. US data, although still weak, seemed to support views that the present slowdown will not be deep or long-lasting. The Fed did not meet in May, although the increased headline inflation rate combined with rising consumer inflation expectations have led markets to factor in a rate rise by the end of 2008.</p>
<p>In Australia, further evidence of slowing domestic demand emerged. Although inflation, currently at 4.2%, is running at a higher rate than the RBA would like, the Bank believes that it should decline over time if demand moderates as is currently expected, leading to rates being left unchanged in June. In the other major economies, central bankers continue to take a cautious policy approach based on concern over uncertainty in global financial markets and rising inflation, with Japan, the UK and the European Central Bank leaving rates unchanged in May.</p>
<p>Equity markets were mixed in May. Concerns about oil prices and inflation influenced stock markets, resulting in a month of volatility, although far milder than that of recent months. Performance of equity markets in May reflected the view that, although the &lsquo;credit crunch&rsquo; is far from over, the low point may have been reached. It remains to be seen, however, if this is a sustained turnaround. Overall, the MSCI developed markets world index rose 1.2% on the back of good performances in Japan and Germany, whilst emerging markets as a whole performed even better, gaining 1.5%.</p>
<p>The US market alternated between good and bad weeks, with the S&amp;P 500 up 1.1% over the month. Elsewhere, the ASX 200 also finished up 1.1% with continued strength in the energy sector. The European Stoxx was down 0.4%, and in Asia, the Shanghai 180 fell 8.8% following the earthquake, the Hang Seng finished down 4.7%, while the Nikkei gained 3.5%. India eased after a strong April, down 5% for May while the Brazilian Bovespa continues to be the best perfored of the large emerging markets, rising 7% for May.</p>
<p>Government bonds were sold in May as markets responded to central bank talk of inflation risks. US bond yields moved up in May, finishing the month up by around 25 basis points. Australian 10-year Commonwealth bond yields were driven by the pattern of US yields, ending the month up 25 basis points at 6.53%.</p>
<p>The $A rose against all the major currencies in May, up 1.4% against the US$ and reaching a new 24-year high of 96.32 US cents, with some forecasters suggesting parity against the US$ may occur for the first time since the currency was floated. Commodity price fluctuations and the dumping of the Yen as investor risk aversion fell dominated movements in the $A. The US$ rise against the Yen (1.5%), Euro 0.4%), and Sterling (0.3%). The US$ was supported by expectations that the rate cutting cycle in the US has ended, while the Yen was hampered by comments from the Bank of Japan governor hosing down expectations of an interest rate rise.</p>
<p>Precious metals regained some lost ground in May. Results for base metals were generally poor, with nickel falling 23.4%, while copper prices fell 6.3% as Chilean strikes ended. The end of May saw the Economist base metals index down 5.1%, the gold price up 2.1% and the price of West Texas Intermediate Oil up 11.6% for the month. Overall, the CRB index of commodity prices finished 2.8% lower in May.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Events in the US economy continued to dictate terms to markets in April. However, the news was less negative, with better than expected earnings reports and macroeconomic data showing the global downturn was still moderate. Growth data released showed the US economy grew by 0.6% in the March quarter, its weakest performance in five years. The Fed again cut the Federal Funds rate, this time by 25 basis points. However, with the rate now down to 2.00% markets now expect the Fed to pause.</p>
<p>In Australia, domestic demand slowed and unemployment rose slightly above the record lows of March, although robust growth is still forecast for 2008. Inflation concerns increased with March quarter CPI figures indicating an annual rate of 4.2%. Slowing domestic demand and uncertainty in international financial markets saw the RBA decide to leave interest rates unchanged in May. In the other major economies, central bankers continue to take a cautious policy approach based on concern over economic conditions in the US and volatility in global financial markets, with the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank leaving rates unchanged in April. Clear evidence of slowing in the UK led the Bank of England to lower rates by 25 basis points to 5.00%.</p>
<p>Equity markets worldwide made gains in April. Equity markets fell early in the month then rose after some US firms released better than expected earnings reports. Performance of equity markets in April reflected the view that, although the &lsquo;credit crunch&rsquo; is far from over, the low point may have been reached. It remains to be seen, however, if this is a sustained turnaround. Overall, the MSCI Developed Markets world index rose 5.9% in April whilst Emerging Markets as a whole performed even better, gaining 7.0%.</p>
<p>The US market performed poorly for the first half of April, before making strong gains in the second half to see the S&amp;P 500 up 4.8% over the month. Elsewhere, the ASX 200 finished up 4.5% with strong results across non-consumer sectors. The European Stoxx was up 5.5%, and in Asia, the Shanghai 180 grew 6.4%, the Hang Seng finished up 12.7%.and the Nikkei gained 10.6%. India recorded its best performance since October, up 11%, while the Brazilian Bovespa is at record highs after S&amp;P upgraded the country&rsquo;s credit rating, also rising 11% for the month.</p>
<p>Government bonds were sold heavily in April as investors renewed their appetite for risk. Japanese bonds in particular were sold heavily - with sell-offs so severe that a 15 minute halt in trading was ordered on the 25th - and yields rose significantly, up 31 basis points for the month. US bond yields moved up in April, finishing the month up 33 basis points. Australian 10-year Commonwealth bond yields ended the month up 25 basis points at 6.29%.</p>
<p>The A$ rose against all the major currencies in April, up 3.2% against the US$ and reaching a new 24-year high of 95.41 US cents, with some forecasters suggesting parity against the US$ may occur for the first time since the currency was floated. Commodity price fluctuations and the dumping of the Yen, as investor risk aversion fell, supported the A$.&nbsp; The US$ rose against the Yen (4.1%), Euro (0.9%), and fell slightly against the Sterling (-0.2%).</p>
<p>Precious metal prices fell in April as investor aversion to risk eased. Results for base metals were mixed, with aluminium and nickel falling, but copper prices rising as strikes constrained world supply. April saw the Economist base metals index up 3.8%, the gold price down 6.7% and the price of West Texas Intermediate Oil up 11.7%. Overall, the CRB index of commodity prices finished 4.3% higher in April.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Events in the US economy continued to dictate terms on markets in March, especially the generally negative economic data releases and the collapse of Bear Stearns. The data suggested the US economy may contract modestly in the first half of 2008, followed by weak growth in the second half. The Fed&rsquo;s attempts to stimulate the US economy with a 75 basis point cut in the federal funds rate, and with a decision to accept suitable rated paper from the large US investment banks as security against liquidity proved to be the circuit breaker in financial markets.</p>
<p>In Australia, the economy remained strong, with robust growth forecast for 2008 and unemployment continuing at 33 year lows. Inflation remains a concern however there is evidence that domestic demand is moderating, resulting in a decision by the RBA to leave interest rates unchanged in April. In the other major economies, central bankers are continue to take a cautious policy approach based on concern over economic conditions in the US and volatility in global financial markets. The Japanese, UK and European central banks all kept rates steady in March.</p>
<p>Equity markets worldwide fell in March, although many markets were showing signs of recovery in the latter stages of the month, after the Fed announced a 75 basis point cut in the target rate. Most of these losses have been attributed to ongoing market volatility and bad economic news coming from the US. This is likely to continue at least for the next few months until the economic situation in the US becomes more certain. Overall, the MSCI developed markets world index fell 2.4% in March whilst Emerging markets as a whole performed fairly poorly, falling 4.3%.</p>
<p>The US was the best performer of the major developed nations in March, with the S&amp;P 500 falling by just 0.6%. Elsewhere, the ASX 200 finished down 3.9% with poor results across most industry sectors. The European Stoxx was down 2.7%, and in Asia, the Shanghai 180 fell 18.9%, the Hang Seng finished down 6.1%.and the Nikkei lost 7.9%. The significant falls in Asian markets &ndash; which recovered towards the end of the month - have been attributed to fears of the effect of a possible US recession on China&rsquo;s economy and global financial turmoil leading to lower investor appetite for risk.</p>
<p>Concern over global economic conditions and weak share markets continue to influence bond markets. US bond yields continued their downward trend in March, finishing 10bps lower for the month. While the 75 basis point cut in official interest rates helped to keep US bond yields low, the difficult credit market conditions reduced the effectiveness of monetary policy. Australian 10-year Commonwealth bond yields were driven by falls in US bond yields and the ongoing bad economic news coming out of the US, finishing 17bps down at 5.87%.</p>
<p>The $A fell against all the major currencies in March, down 1.9% against the US$ to finish at 91.4 US cents. Commodity price fluctuations and the safe-haven purchasing of the Yen dominated movements in the A$. The US$ fell against the Yen (-3.6%), Euro (-3.9%) and made small gains against the sterling (0.3%). The US$ was dominated by ongoing announcements of poor economic data and concerns that the US is heading into recession.</p>
<p>Emerging markets economies continued to expand strongly. One consequence; very large increases in the contract prices for coal and iron ore which, inter alia, will flow through into a considerable boost to revenues of Australian producers and, in turn, the broader economy. At the same time, March saw falls in the spot prices for many commodities with the Economist base metals index down 0.2%, the gold price down 4.0% and the price of West Texas Intermediate Oil down 0.3%. Overall, the CRB index of commodity prices finished 3.9% lower in March.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>All eyes continue to be firmly fixed on the US economy with a string of negative data over February pointing to conditions becoming worse than many analysts expected. Whether the US has entered a recession or narrowly avoids one is still uncertain, but a significant economic slowdown is underway.</p>
<p>Despite troubles in the US the Australian economy remains strong &ndash; robust growth is forecast for 2008 and unemployment stands at 33 year lows. Inflation remains a concern leading to the RBA raising official interest rates on the 4th of March by 25 bps to 7.25%. In the other major economies, central bankers are taking a cautious policy approach based on concern over economic conditions in the US and volatility in global financial markets. Both the Japanese and European central banks kept rates steady, while the Bank of England reduced rates in February.</p>
<p>February didn&rsquo;t see the large swings in world equity markets that have characterised recent months, with most major countries posting only small changes overall. Investors are still firmly focussed on economic conditions in the US and this has lead to skittish behaviour surrounding the release of key economic data. This is likely to continue at least for the next few months until the economic situation in the US becomes more certain. On a positive note, concern that a slowing developed world will drag down emerging markets has so far proved unfounded, with emerging markets posting solid gains for the most part over February.</p>
<p>The US was the worst performer of the major developed nations, the S&amp;P 500 falling 3.5% over the month. Elsewhere, the MSCI developed markets world index fell by 1.9% whilst the ASX 200 finished down 1.4% but was boosted by strong gains in commodities&nbsp; The European Stoxx was down 1.1%, while in Asia, the Shanghai 180 gained 0.7%, the Hang Seng gained 3.7%.and the Nikkei finished 0.1% higher. Emerging markets as a whole performed strongly for the month, rising 6.0%.</p>
<p>Concern over global economic conditions and weak share markets continue to influence bond markets in the US and Australia over February. In the US, bond yields were spurred by the stimulus provided by the 125bps Fed fund drop in late January, before economic concerns dragged them back down. Overall US 10-year bond yields finished the month down 10bps. In Australia, hawkish comments from the RBA were partially offset by the negative economic data which came out of the US towards the end of the month. Australian 10-year Commonwealth bond yields finished 12bps up at 6.21% in February.</p>
<p>The $A gained against all major currencies in February, up 4.0% against the US$ to finish at 93.2 US cents. Increased expectations of rate rises in the first half of 2008 boosted the A$ throughout the month. The US$ fell against the yen (-2.5%), euro (-2.2%) and remained unchanged against the sterling. The US$ was dominated by continuing speculation of a downturn in economic activity.</p>
<p>Commodity markets continued their rises started in January to record large price gains across the board this month. The West Texas Intermediate Oil price rose 11.0% and broke the $100 per barrel mark for the first time. Rising production costs and supply constraints helped the Economist base metal index climb by 18.2%. Gold and silver both performed strongly and reached new highs as investors sought the relative safety of the precious metals. Overall, the CRB index of commodity prices finished 8.8% higher in February.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Financial markets were volatile in January, with stock markets selling off and bond markets rallying. Economic news from the US was disappointing and the IMF downgraded its forecasts for global growth in 2008.&nbsp; Adding to the negative sentiment were concerns that the credit crunch would claim more casualties, e.g. amongst US bond insurers, and cause more write-downs and losses.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the month markets were calmed by the US Fed&rsquo;s decision to cut interest rates by 125bps. In early February, the Bank of England also cut rates and the ECB switched its policy bias from tightening to neutral. Meanwhile, money markets were functioning better and there was increased stability in the US corporate paper markets. Altogether, this added to the feeling that even if the US is entering a recession, it will be a mild one. In sharp contrast, the Reserve Bank of Australia weighed up financial uncertainty against strong domestic demand and decided on a 25bps interest rate rise in early February to rein in inflation. It has signalled that further increases are likely.</p>
<p>A volatile start to the year saw stocks fall rapidly around the globe before the US Fed intervened. Fourth quarter earnings results for the US revealed large losses in financials, but generally positive results in other sectors. Double digit drops in most global markets were reversed somewhat in the last week and a half, with this momentum continuing into early February.<br /><br />Overall for January, the S&amp;P 500 fell 6.1%and the European Stoxx was down 13.0%, leading to an 8.5% drop in the global developed share market index. Locally, the ASX 200 fell by 10.9% after decreasing by as much as 18% early on.&nbsp; Asian markets were hit hard with the Shanghai 180 and the Hang Seng dropping 15.0% and 15.7% respectively, whilst the Nikkei recorded a comparatively mild fall of 11.2%. Emerging markets lost 12.6% in January.</p>
<p>Uncertainty over global economic conditions and weak share markets saw a month of volatility in bond markets. US bond yields reached a four and a half year low on the 22nd,before bonds sold off over the final days, leaving yields recording a 40bps drop for the month overall. Australian bond yields fell less under stronger domestic growth prospects and still high inflation forecasts. Australian 10-year Commonwealth bond yields finished 24bps down at 6.09%.</p>
<p>The $A had a solid month against most major currencies, gaining 2.3% against the US$ to finish at 89.6 US cents. A return to carry trading later in the month helped the A$ regain ground lost earlier while continued speculation over economic conditions in the US played against the $A. The US$ fell against the yen (-4.7%), euro (-1.8%) and sterling (-0.1%). Two rate drops of a combined 125bps placed downward pressure on the US$.</p>
<p>Commodity markets overcame slowing demand to record large gains for several commodities, partly as the result of new-year investment flows, but also due to supply problems across several major producers. However, the West Texas Intermediate oil price fell 4.4% upon lower growth prospects in the US and easing geopolitical tensions which had elevated prices over recent months. The major metals rose, helping the Economist base metal index climb by 6.3%.&nbsp; Gold and silver both performed strongly and reached new highs as investors sought the relative safety of the precious metals. Overall, the CRB index of commodity prices finished 2.7% higher in January.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>When you draw all or part of your money out of your super savings, it may be subject to taxation by the Federal Government. The amount of tax depends on a range of factors, including:</p>

<li>Whether there are tax-free or taxable components</li>
<li>Your age</li>
<li>The size of your payout</li>

<p>Prime Super recommends that you seek professional financial and taxation advice before taking any action.</p>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>If you are an employee of an Australian company and earn $450 or more per calendar month, your employer is legally required to make contributions into an approved super fund on your behalf.</p>
<p>The minimum amount your employer is required to pay, known as the Superannuation Guarantee or SG, is calculated as a percentage of your wage. The SG rate for 2014-15 is 9.5% of your Ordinary Time Earnings (OTE) into a superannuation fund. OTE includes any over-award payments or allowances you may receive, but does not include overtime payments.</p>]]></mainContent>

However, you should be aware that some funds charge high exit fees for people who wish to transfer their super accounts out of their funds. It is a good idea to consider the cost of any exit fees that may apply, as well as the long-term cost of staying in the other fund. You should also take into consideration the impact of cancelling any insurance cover held with your super fund.</p>]]></mainContent>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Prime Super offers employers and members two divisions: the Prime division and the HIP division. The HIP division came about through our merger with Health Industry Plan (HIP) on 1 May 2014.</p>
<p>The Prime division is open to all employers and individuals across Australia. The HIP division is restricted to employers and individuals working in the health and related industries.</p>
<p>The only difference between the two divisions is the insurance offering. All other aspects (investment options, fees, support, employer contribution methods, etc.) are identical.</p>]]></mainContent>

            <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>Concessional contributions are those contributions for which a tax deduction is claimed (these include personal contributions for the self-employed or employer-sponsored/salary sacrifice contributions). These concessional contributions are taxed at a standard rate of 15% inside your super fund.</p>
<p>There is a limit to the amount you can claim as a tax deduction and therefore receive at a concessional tax rate. For information about the current financial year&rsquo;s cap, please see visit the <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au/" target="_blank">ATO website</a>.</p>
<p>If you make contributions in excess of the cap, all excess contributions will be taxed at an additional amount. Please refer to the <a href="http://www.ato.gov.au/" target="_blank">ATO website</a>&nbsp;for additional information.</p>
<p>Once the ATO assesses that this additional tax is payable, you can elect to pay it either from your super account or from other savings.</p>]]></mainContent>

<p>These contributions can be made by you up to the age of 75.</p>

<p>If your non-concessional contributions exceed the cap, the excess amount will be subject to extra tax. This tax can be paid from your super account, other savings or both.</p>

      <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>On 12 March 2014, the new Australian Privacy Principles (<strong>APPs</strong>) came into force replacing the existing National Privacy Principles and Information Privacy Principles. This Privacy Statement has been updated to comply with these APPs.</p>
<p>Privacy laws regulate, among other matters, the way we collect, use, disclose, keep secure and give access to personal or sensitive information. You or your employer will provide personal and/or sensitive information about you to the Fund for the purpose of establishing and administering your membership in the Fund. This personal and/or sensitive information may include your name, address, date of birth, telephone number, email address, tax file number, health condition and your nominated beneficiaries if these details have been provided. The Trustee may use your personal and/or sensitive information for related purposes and may disclose your information to ensure the efficient management of your membership in the Fund.</p>
<p>From time-to-time, we may collect personal or sensitive information about you from a third party such as your employer or another entity involved in activities related to your membership in the Fund. We will only use your personal or sensitive information for the purpose of administering, or purposes related to the efficient management of, your membership in the Fund.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;re a member you can provide your consent via our <a href="/{localLink:1340}" title="Fetch my super">Fetch My Super</a>&nbsp;tool and we will search for any super you have elsewhere then help you roll it in to your Prime Super account.</p>
<h3>Make an investment choice</h3>
<p>Take control of your future with a personalised investment for your super.</p>

<h3>Increase your insurance</h3>
<p>When you join Prime Super, we provide you with a default level of cover. But this isn&rsquo;t always enough to protect you against life&rsquo;s unpleasant surprises</p>
<p>Prime Super buys insurance policies in bulk, which reduces the premiums paid per member and means you pay less for your policy than you would if you purchased it privately. This means you can afford to have the cover you need.</p>
<p>Read our <a href="/media/1352/primeh-51-are-you-adequately-covered-guide-lr-final.pdf" title="PrimeH-51 Are You Adequately Covered Guide LR FINAL.pdf"><em>Are you adequately covered? guide (Prime division)</em></a> or <em>Are you adequately covered? guide (HIP division</em>) (coming soon) to see if you are adequately covered.</p>
<h3>Nominate a beneficiary</h3>
<p>If you die whilst you are a member of Prime Super and you do not nominate a beneficiary, your account and any insurance benefit will be paid to your dependants or your estate. If you have neither, your death benefit will be paid to another person as determined by the trustee, in accordance with the law. This might not always be in line with your wishes.</p>
<p>We recommend nominating a preferred or binding beneficiary to receive your death benefit should you die while you are a member of the Fund. This will give us some direction as to how you would like want your death benefit paid. Fill out the relevant section of the member application form or the <a href="#">Nomination of beneficiary form</a> to nominate a beneficiary.</p>]]></mainContent>

      <mainContent><![CDATA[<h2>For many people the contributions their employer makes won&rsquo;t be enough to give them a comfortable retirement.</h2>
<p>The best way to make sure you have enough is to boost your super.</p>
<p>You can choose to make two types of super contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>After tax (non-concessional) contributions, which could make you eligible to receive Government Co-contributions. Click <a href="/tools-resources/learning-centre/7-ways-to-grow-your-super/" target="_blank">here</a> to learn more.</li>
<li>Before tax (concessional) contributions, for example salary sacrifice purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also be able to receive Spouse Contribution rebates. Your spouse can make contributions to your account no matter what you earn, but if you're on a low income, they may be able to claim an income tax offset. Visit the <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals/super/in-detail/contributions/spouse-super-contribution-tax-offset/" target="_blank">ATO page on spouse contributions</a> for more information.</p>
<h2>Make a contribution</h2>
<p>Here are a few ways you can make a contribution into your super account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fill in <a href="/media/1535/prime89_0215-ongoing-contributions-form.pdf" target="_blank">this form</a> to make ongoing contributions from your salary directly into your super account. Just fill in the form and give it to your employer.</li>
<li>Transfer money to your Prime Super account using BPAY, EFT or regular direct debit &ndash; simply go to the <strong>Member</strong>&nbsp;tab in your MemberOnline account, select <strong>Payment Methods</strong>&nbsp;and follow the instructions. Alternatively, complete a <a href="/media/1221/primeh-23-personal-contributions-form_final-lr.pdf" target="_blank">Personal Contributions form</a> and return it to us.</li>

      <title><![CDATA[Your investments]]></title>
      <mainContent><![CDATA[<p>How your super is invested can play a major role in how much money you have saved when you retire.</p>
<p>When you joined Prime Super, unless you made a choice, your money was automatically invested in the MySuper or &lsquo;balanced&rsquo; account option. However, Prime Super offers nine different investment options and depending on your age and personal circumstances, it might be worth considering an investment choice.</p>
<p>Just a few small changes to your investments now could make a world of difference to your account balance over time. With the benefits of compounding interest, an increase of 2% in average investment returns over a 45 year period could mean an extra $181,000* in your super account by the time you retire! Just think what a difference that could make to your comfort in retirement.</p>
<h2>Making a choice</h2>
<p>To work out which investment option to choose, read our <a href="/media/1243/primeh-55-investment-choice-guide_lr.pdf" target="_blank">Investment Choice guide</a>. There is a quiz on page 12 which will give you an idea of which investment option/s may suit you.</p>
<p>You can choose one investment option or a number of options and Prime Super offers guidance and professional financial advice, if you need help making a decision. <br />Generally, the closer you are to retirement the more conservative your investment choice may be as you have less years to make up any losses you may incur, however if you are planning on transferring your super to an income stream your money would continue to be invested for another 20 or more years which would provide a buffer against loss.</p>
<p>If you have 20 or 30 years until you retire, you may consider a higher risk option. It is important to note that each investment option has different risk and return targets, and those investments which provide the greatest returns often carry the most risk.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Your insurance options]]></title>
      <mainContent><![CDATA[<h2>Our ability to earn a wage to provide for ourselves and our family is something we tend to take for granted.</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">But what if you became ill or injured, or worse passed away, how would you and your family meet your ongoing living expenses?</span></p>
<p>The good news is that your Prime Super account comes with automatic Death &amp; Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) insurance cover (if you are a member of the Health division it also comes with automatic Income Protection cover). However, this is a basic level of insurance and it is important to review your policies from time-to-time to ensure your cover adequately meets your needs and personal circumstances.</p>
<h2>Types of cover available</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Death cover</strong> &ndash; provides a benefit to your beneficiary upon your death or to you if you are diagnosed with a terminal illness</li>
<li><strong>TPD cover</strong> &ndash; provides you with a lump sum payment in the event that you sustain an illness or injury which prevents you from ever working again</li>
<li><strong>Income protection</strong> &ndash; provides you with a regular income of up to 75-85% (depending on what division you are in) of your monthly salary for up to two years in the event that you are unable to work for an extended period due to illness or injury.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Top up your insurance cover</h2>
<p><strong>Prime division members</strong> - you can apply for more cover or add Income Protection insurance online by simply logging in to your <a href="https://member.aas.com.au/login/PR" target="_blank">MemberOnline</a> account, selecting the <strong>Insurance details</strong> tab and following the links.</p>
<p><strong>Health division members</strong> &ndash; you can apply for additional cover by completing a <a href="/media/1343/primeh-146-hip-short-form-personal-statement-deathtpd_final_web.pdf" target="_blank">Short-form Personal Statement (Death and/or TPD)</a> and/or a <a href="/media/1320/primeh-147-hip-short-form-personal-statement-income-protection-form_web.pdf" target="_blank">Short-form Personal Statement for Income Protection</a> and returning it to us.</p>
<p><br />In assessing the amount of cover you require, it is important to consider your current and future financial obligations and your ability to meet those, e.g. with money saved or invested. This <a href="/media/1544/howmuchisenough_budget-tool.pdf" target="_blank">budget tool</a> can help you work out how much insurance you need.</p>
<p><br />It is important to note that insurance within super is generally less expensive than policies purchased outside the super environment. And, because premiums are paid from your super, there are no out-of-pocket expenses for you.</p>

<p>Prime Super also offers financial planning services to members at heavily discounted rates, should you require more detailed advice.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Government co-contributions]]></title>
      <mainContent><![CDATA[<h2>Get a super boost from the Government</h2>
<p>Want to boost your super? &nbsp;If you are a lower income earner you should take advantage of the Government co-contribution scheme &ndash; where the Government gives you 50 cents for every dollar you contribute to your super, up to certain limits. That&rsquo;s a <strong>50% return</strong> on your money. Government payments are limited to $500 and you have to meet certain conditions to be eligible.</p>
<h3>Make sure you get your share of the Government&rsquo;s super money for this financial year</h3>
<p>All you have to do is make a voluntary after-tax contribution to your super account <strong>before 30 June 2016</strong>. It&rsquo;s easy to do &ndash; just make your contributions and if you qualify, your co-contribution will automatically be paid into your account by the ATO.</p>
<h3>How to make a voluntary contribution</h3>
<p>Making a voluntary contribution to your Prime Super member account is easy.&nbsp;We have a range of different payment options but the easiest and quickest way to make a contribution is by BPAY or cheque.</p>
<p><strong>1. BPAY&reg;</strong> &ndash; this is the easiest way to make a payment quickly, securely, and any time you like. All you need are your Prime Super BPAY details below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Biller Code: 584581</li>
<li>Reference Number: <strong>phone 1800 675 839 for your reference number </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Make a chequ</strong>e out to Prime Super; <a href="/media/1221/primeh-23-personal-contributions-form_final-lr.pdf" target="_blank" title="contribution form">fill in this form</a>, pop it in the mail to us.</p>
<p>Note: It can take three or four business days to process your payment so please allow for this when making contributions up to 30 June.</p>
<h3>How much am I entitled to?</h3>
<p>The amount of the co-contribution you receive will depend on your income and the amount of personal contributions you make. So the more you pay in up to the maximum co-contribution threshold the more you will receive from the Government. Plus, like your personal contributions, the co-contribution is not taxed when it is paid into your account and it is not taxed later when you withdraw it as part of your retirement benefit (when you are over 60).</p>
<p>Use the table below as a guide to work out the maximum co-contribution amount you could receive based on your salary and voluntary contribution level.</p>
<table border="0" width="644" height="110">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>Total income for the financial year</strong></td>

<h3>Do I qualify?</h3>
<p>If you can answer yes to the following questions, you&rsquo;re good to go.</p>
<ul>
<li>Will you be aged under 71 on 30 June 2016?</li>
<li>Are you a permanent Australian resident and have been throughout the whole 2015-16 year?</li>
<li>Will you earn less than $50,454 (this includes your assessable income and any reportable fringe benefits) this financial year?</li>
<li>Will you earn at least 10% of your income from employment or self-employment activities this financial year?</li>
<li>Will you lodge a tax return this financial year? Does Prime Super have your Tax File Number (TFN) on record?</li>
<li>Have you made voluntary personal (after-tax) contributions to your super account this financial year?</li>
</ul>
<h3>We&rsquo;re here to help</h3>
